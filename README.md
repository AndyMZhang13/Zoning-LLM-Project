# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT







Be Advised: This project is still a proof of concept, and is not particularly user friendly

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

### SETUP DEPENDANCIES:
The program runs locally on your machine, and certain packages need to be installed. It is assumed that Python is installed properly on the system already.

QUICK INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
For Windows:
Copy and paste the following into your terminal
pip install pymupdf faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers torch tqdm protobuf==3.20.3 keras==2.11.0 tensorflow==2.11.0

For Linxus and MacOS:
pip3 install pymupdf faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers torch tqdm protobuf==3.20.3 keras==2.11.0 tensorflow==2.11.0

For Troubleshooting:
Search the internet for whatever error you may encounter during setup by copying the error message into the search engine or chatbot.

SETUP:
The program takes a .pdf file as input, and the path to your desired pdf file must be known on your computer

Inside of zoning_code.py:
Replace the pdf_path variable with path to pdf (right click copy path, then fix formatting)
EXAMPLE: pdf_path = "C:/Users/EXAMPLEUSER/.vscode/SOMEFOLDER/test.pdf" 

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS:
Run zoning_code.py to generate embeddings and text chunks
Then run query_faiss_local.py to query the locally generated files
This will allow you to type into the terminal your search query. Hitting enter will submit that query. To exit the program, enter "exit" or "quit" into the terminal

KNOWN ISSUES AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- You must clean artifacts of old pdfs if you want to use it on a new pdf file. You can simply delete the files generated by the code
