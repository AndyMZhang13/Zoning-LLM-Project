# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to extract and interpret zoning regulations from municipal planning documents, with the goal of improving the speed, accuracy, and accessibility of land use analysis. Specifically, we tested whether a query-based model could surface relevant zoning provisions from long and complex PDF documents when given a targeted prompt. This proof-of-concept aims to support infrastructure planning by streamlining zoning research, reducing manual review time, and enabling quicker comparison of local codes against environmental or planning benchmarks. Our ultimate objective is to assess whether this approach can inform the design of tools that identify gaps in zoning policy and promote more sustainable, efficient, and equitable land use.

Be Advised: This project is still a proof of concept, and is not particularly user friendly

## SUMMARY OF PROGRAM DESIGN:
The program is split into 2 main section, the script zoning_code.py reads a pdf and breaks it down into chunks. Then, those chunks are embedded using an existing open source model for Natural Language Processing. This is stored via local files that are accessed later down the line
The script query_faiss_local.py accesses the files generated by zoning_code.py and allows for the comparison between a query entered by the user and the embedded chunks. This will then present a list of the most "similar" chunks of text to the user query from the pdf. 

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

### SETUP DEPENDANCIES:
The program runs locally on your machine, and certain packages need to be installed. It is assumed that Python is installed properly on the system already.

QUICK INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
For Windows:
Copy and paste the following into your terminal
pip install pymupdf faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers torch tqdm protobuf==3.20.3 keras==2.11.0 tensorflow==2.11.0

For Linxus and MacOS:
pip3 install pymupdf faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers torch tqdm protobuf==3.20.3 keras==2.11.0 tensorflow==2.11.0

For Troubleshooting:
Search the internet for whatever error you may encounter during setup by copying the error message into the search engine or chatbot.

SETUP:
The program takes a .pdf file as input, and the path to your desired pdf file must be known on your computer

Inside of zoning_code.py:
Replace the pdf_path variable with path to pdf (right click copy path, then fix formatting)
EXAMPLE: pdf_path = "C:/Users/EXAMPLEUSER/.vscode/SOMEFOLDER/test.pdf" 

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS:
Run zoning_code.py to generate embeddings and text chunks
Then run query_faiss_local.py to query the locally generated files
This will allow you to type into the terminal your search query. Hitting enter will submit that query. To exit the program, enter "exit" or "quit" into the terminal

KNOWN ISSUES AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- You must clean artifacts of old pdfs if you want to use it on a new pdf file. You can simply delete the files generated by the code
