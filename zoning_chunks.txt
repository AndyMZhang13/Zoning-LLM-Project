This title shall be known as the Oakland Planning Code, may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein by such title or as "this Code." (Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.020 Title of general provisions. The provisions of Chapters 17.01 through 17.05 shall be known as the General Provisions of the Planning Code. (Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.030 Conformity with General Plan required. Except as otherwise provided by Section 17.01.040, no activities or facilities shall be established, substituted, expanded, constructed, altered, moved, painted, maintained, or otherwise changed, and no lot lines shall be created or changed, except in conformity with the Oakland General Plan. To the extent that

--- Chunk 7 ---
there is an express conflict between the Oakland General Plan and the Zoning Regulations, this requirement shall supersede the requirement for conformity with the Zoning Regulations stipulated in Section 17.07.060 (formerly Section 17.02.060). (Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) --- Page 7 --- OAKLAND 7 17.01.040 Exceptions to requirement for General Plan conformity. The provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed to preclude the operation, maintenance, and occupancy of any activity or facility that existed lawfully prior to the effective date of this Chapter. Such activities and facilities shall be subject to the Nonconforming Use Regulations in Chapter 17.114. (Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.050 General Plan prevails over Planning Code and Subdivision Regulations. Until the Planning Code is fully updated, land use designations, zoning controls, and subdivision controls specified by the Planning Code and Subdivision Regulations shall apply, except where such action would expressly conflict with the Oakland General Plan. Where an express conflict does arise, the General Plan policies and land use designations shall apply. An "express conflict" shall be deemed to be any situation where a proposal clearly conforms with the General Plan but is not permitted by the portion of Zoning Regulations that have

--- Chunk 8 ---
not been fully updated, or where a proposal clearly does not conform with the General Plan, but is permitted or conditionally permitted by the portion of Zoning Regulations that have not been fully updated. The provisions of Sections 17.01.070 through 17.01.080 shall be used to determine whether an express conflict exists and the provisions of Sections 17.01.100 through 17.01.120, as applicable, shall then be followed. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.070 Determination of General Plan conformity by Director of City Planning. The Director of City Planning shall determine whether any specific proposal conforms to the General Plan. Any interested party may apply for a written General Plan conformity determination upon payment of a fee as prescribed in the city master fee schedule. Prior to making a decision, there shall be notice given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property in the city within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved pursuant to Section 17.134.040; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings.

(Ord. 12514 § 2 (part), 2003: Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.080 Appeal of Director's determination. A. Within ten (10) calendar days of a written determination by the Director of City Planning pursuant to Section 17.01.070, an appeal of such determination may be taken to the City Planning Commission by the applicant or any other interested party. Such appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as prescribed in the City master fee schedule, and shall be processed in accordance with the administrative appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. B. Within ten (10) calendar days of a written determination by the Director of City Planning pursuant to Subsection 17.01.120.C. an appeal of such determination may be taken to the City Council by the applicant or any other interested party. Such appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as prescribed in the City master fee schedule. In event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed --- Page 8 --- OAKLAND 8 by the Director and shall be filed

--- Chunk 10 ---
with the City Clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Planning Director or wherein his or her decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Council shall set the date for consideration thereof. After the hearing date is set, the Planning Director shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission for its review and advice. The Planning Commission shall consider the matter at its next available meeting. Such referral shall be only for the purpose of issue clarification and advice to the City Council. The City Clerk shall not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the Council hearing, give written notice of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal to the applicant; the appellant in those cases where the applicant is not the appellant; adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as the Secretary deems appropriate. In considering the appeal, the Council shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the

--- Chunk 11 ---
provisions of Subsection 17.01.120.C., and may approve or disapprove the proposed determination. The decision of the City Council shall be made by resolution and shall be final. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 12514 § 2 (part), 2003: Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.100 Proposals clearly in conformance with General Plan. A. If Permitted or Conditionally Permitted by Zoning Regulations (No "Express Conflict"). Any proposal determined to clearly conform with the General Plan and which is permitted or conditionally permitted by the Zoning Regulations shall be processed in accordance with such code and/or regulations. B. If Not Permitted by the portion of Zoning Regulations not fully updated ("Express Conflict"). Any proposal determined to clearly conform with the General Plan and which is not permitted by the portion of Zoning Regulations not fully updated may be approved upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134. Such use permit shall be processed as a minor conditional use permit or a major conditional use permit in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 17.134. A conditional

--- Chunk 12 ---
use permit for such proposal may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in Section 17.134.050 and to the following additional use permit criteria: 1. That the proposal is clearly appropriate in consideration of the characteristics of the proposal and the surrounding area; 2. That the proposal is clearly consistent with the intent and desired character of the relevant land use classification or classifications of the General Plan and any associated policies; 3. That the proposal will clearly promote implementation of the General Plan. Any such proposal shall be subject to the provisions of the "best fit zone" corresponding to the land use classification in which the proposal is located. If there is more than one "best fit zone," the Director of City Planning shall determine which zone to apply, with consideration given to the characteristics of the proposal and the surrounding area and any relevant provisions of the General Plan. C. Optional Rezoning in Lieu of Conditional Use Permit ("Express Conflict"). At his or her option, in lieu of the conditional use permit provided for by Subsection B. of this Section, the applicant may apply for a rezoning pursuant

--- Chunk 13 ---
to the rezoning and law change procedure in Chapter --- Page 9 --- OAKLAND 9 17.144. Any such rezoning shall be to the "best fit zone" or other possible zone corresponding to the land use classification in which the proposal is located. If such a rezoning is approved, the proposal shall then be subject to all of the provisions of the new zone, including but not limited to, any required conditional use permit. (Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.110 Proposals for which General Plan is silent or not clear on conformance. A. If Permitted or Conditionally Permitted by Zoning Regulations (No "Express Conflict"). Any proposal for which the General Plan is silent or not clear as regards conformity and which is permitted or conditionally permitted by the Zoning Regulations shall be processed in accordance with such code and/or regulations. B. If Not Permitted by Zoning Regulations (No "Express Conflict"). Any proposal for which the General Plan is silent or not clear as regards conformity, and which is not permitted by the Zoning Regulations shall be processed in accordance with such code and/or regulations. At his or her option, the applicant may modify

--- Chunk 14 ---
the project to conform to the code and/or regulations, may apply for a variance pursuant to the variance procedure in Chapter 17.148, or may apply for a rezoning pursuant to the rezoning and law change procedure in Chapter 17.144. Any such rezoning shall be to the "best fit zone" or other possible zone corresponding to the land use classification in which the proposal is located. If such a rezoning is approved, the proposal shall then be subject to all of the provisions of the new zone, including but not limited to, any required conditional use permit. (Ord. 12054 § 2 (part), 1998) 17.01.120 Proposals clearly not in conformance with the General Plan or the Land Use Diagram. Any proposal determined to clearly not conform to the General Plan shall not be allowed and no application shall be accepted, nor shall any permits be approved or issued, for any such proposal, except as provided in this Section or in Section 17.01.040 or Section 17.01.070. A. If Permitted or Conditionally Permitted by Zoning Regulations ("Express Conflict"). At his or her option, the applicant may modify the project to conform to the General Plan, request a General Plan conformity determination from the Director

--- Chunk 15 ---
of City Planning pursuant to Section 17.01.070, or may apply for a General Plan Amendment. If such amendment involves the land use classification, the amendment shall be to the land use classification corresponding to the "best fit zone" or other possible zone in which the proposal is located. B. If Not Permitted by Zoning Regulations (No "Express Conflict"). If proposal is not permitted under the Zoning Regulations, the applicant may apply for a rezoning pursuant to the rezoning and law change procedure in Chapter 17.144 in addition to a General Plan amendment. Any such rezoning shall be to the "best fit zone": or other possible zone corresponding to the land use classification of the associated General Plan amendment. If such a rezoning is approved, the proposal shall then be subject to all of the provisions of the new zone, including but not limited to, any required conditional use permit. C. If permitted or conditionally permitted by Zoning Regulations, and where determined by the Planning Director to be consistent with the surrounding land uses and appropriate for the area, notwithstanding that the project may not be consistent with the General Plan classification shown on the Land Use Diagram. It is recognized

--- Chunk 16 ---
that the General Plan land uses have been broadly applied to areas without parcel by parcel specificity and --- Page 10 --- OAKLAND 10 that the Land Use Diagram details are largely illustrative of the Plan's written goals and policies. Because the Diagram is generalized, and does not necessarily depict the accuracy of each parcel or very small land areas, a determination of project consistency can be requested of the Director of City Planning. The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Director that the predominant use, or average density, is different from that shown on the Diagram and is appropriate for the area in question and that the project is in conformance with the written goals and policies of the General Plan. Written notice of the Director's determination shall be sent to all property owners and occupants within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. The Director's determination may be appealed to the City Planning Commission pursuant to Section 17.01.080B. (Ord. 12514 § 2

--- Chunk 201 ---
feet, and the minimum lot width of any individual lot within such subdivision shall be seventy-five (75) feet. 2. In the RH-4 Zone, for Subdivision Maps of four (4) or fewer lots where each lot created has a buildable area slope of less than or equal to twenty percent (20%), the minimum lot size is six thousand five hundred (6,500) square feet. For Subdivision Maps where any one lot buildable area slope is greater than twenty percent (20%) or for Subdivision Maps of five (5) or more lots, the minimum lot size is increased to eight thousand (8,000) square feet. a. In order to determine buildable area slope of a subdivision, each lot shown on the Subdivision Map shall indicate the buildable area in dashed lines. The buildable area slope is measured at the steepest point between the front and rear setbacks (not included within the side setbacks). 3. See Subsection 16.16.170.F in the Subdivision regulations for additional regulations regarding minimum lot size. In the RH-3 Zone, the minimum average lot area of all lots within a subdivision shall be twelve thousand (12,000) square feet, and the minimum lot area of any individual lot within such subdivision shall be ten

Page 109 --- OAKLAND 109 6. In the RH-4 Zone, if adjacent lots abutting the side lot lines of the subject lot both contain principle Residential Facilities that have front setbacks with a depth of less than twenty (20) feet, the minimum front setback shall be reduced for buildings and other structures on the subject lot up to a line parallel to the front lot line and extended from the most forward projection of the principle Residential Facility on the adjacent lots having the deeper front setback depth, provided such projection is enclosed, has a wall height of at least eight (8) feet, and has a width of at least five (5) feet. In the case of a corner lot or lot that has one or more vacant parcels next to it, this same principle shall apply if the nearest non-vacant lots to each side of the corner lot, or to each side of a lot that has one or more vacant parcels next to it, have less than a twenty (20) foot front setback (see Illustration for Table 17.13.03, [Additional Regulation 6], below). Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. Illustration for Table 17.13.03 [Additional Regulation 6

See Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. Illustration for Table 17.13.03 [Additional Regulation 7] *for illustration purposes only --- Page 110 --- OAKLAND 110 8. See Section 17.108.080 for the required interior side and rear setbacks on a lot containing two (2) or more living units and opposite a legally-required living room window. 9. The minimum interior side setback for all lots with a footprint slope that exceeds 20% is the greater of the two (2) listed setbacks - in the RH-1 and RH-2 Zones: either six (6) feet or fifteen percent (15%) of the lot width mean, whichever is greater; in the RH-3 Zone: either six (6) feet or ten percent (10%) of the lot width mean, whichever is greater; and in the RH-4

--- Chunk 205 ---
Zone: either five (5) feet or ten percent (10%) of the lot width mean, whichever is greater. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 10. In all RH Zones, on every corner lot which abuts to the rear a key lot which is in a Residential Zone, there shall be provided on the street side of such corner lot a side setback with a minimum width equal to one-half (½) of the minimum front setback depth required on the key lot and no less than the minimum side setback width required along an interior side lot line of the corner lot. However, such side setback shall only apply to the rear twenty (20) feet of the corner lot, and not be required to exceed five (5) feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot. Such setback shall be provided unobstructed except for the accessory structures or the other facilities allowed therein by Section 17.108.130 (see Illustration for Table 17.13.03. [Additional Regulation 10], below). See also Subsection 17.110.040.C for special controls on location of detached accessory buildings on such corner lots and Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections

into setbacks. --- Page 111 --- OAKLAND 111 Illustration for Table 17.13.03 [Additional Regulation 10] *for illustration purposes only 11. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback depth actually on the lot itself shall not be reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 12. For lots which abut an adjoining rear setback, the minimum rear setback depth shall be increased by an additional one-half (½) foot of rear setback depth for each additional one (1) foot of lot depth over one hundred (100) feet, up to a maximum rear setback depth of forty (40) feet. 13. See Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits and Section 17.108.020 for increased height limits in certain situations. 14. In all RH Zones, if at least sixty percent (60%) of the buildings in the immediate context are no more than one (1) story in height, the maximum wall height shall be fifteen (15) feet within the front twelve (12) feet of buildable area. The immediate

--- Chunk 207 ---
context shall consist of the five (5) closest lots on each side of the project site plus the ten (10) closest lots on the opposite side of the street; however, the Director of City Planning may make an alternative determination of immediate context based on specific site conditions. Such determination shall be in writing and included as part of any approval of any variance, conditional use permit, design review, determination of exemption from design review, or other special zoning approval or, if no special zoning approval is required, part of any Planning Department approval of a building permit application. 15. See applicable design review criteria for more specific bulk standards. 16. Off-street parking and loading shall be provided as prescribed in the off-street parking and loading requirements in Chapter 17.116. Bicycle parking shall be provided as prescribed in the bicycle parking regulations in Chapter 17.117. Additional parking standards apply within the S-11 Zone, as prescribed in Chapter 17.92. 17. See Section 17.103.085 for setback and separation requirements for Vehicular Residential Facilities. --- Page 112 --- OAKLAND 112 18. A second primary unit may only be granted in the RH-4 Zone upon determination that: i) The project is not located within

--- Chunk 208 ---
the S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone; and ii) The minimum pavement width along the entire length of the adjoining street is at least twenty-six (26) feet, and all streets connecting the lot to the nearest arterial street (as designated by the City of Oakland General Plan Land Use and Transportation Element) have a minimum pavement width of at least twenty-six (26) feet.

In the RD Zone, on every corner lot which abuts to the rear a key lot which is in a Residential Zone, there shall be provided on the street side of such corner lot a side setback with a minimum width equal to one-half (½) of the minimum front setback depth required on the key lot and no less than the minimum side setback width required along an interior side lot line of the corner lot. However, such side setback shall only apply to the rear ten (10) feet of the corner lot, and not be required to exceed four (4) feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot. Such setback shall be provided unobstructed except for the accessory structures or the other facilities allowed therein by Section 17.108.130 (see Illustration for Table 17.15.03 [Additional Regulation 12], below).

--- Chunk 228 ---

Illustration for Table 17.15.03 [Additional Regulation 12] *for illustration purposes only --- Page 127 --- OAKLAND 127 12. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback depth actually on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 13. In the RD Zone, for lots which abut an adjoining rear setback, the minimum rear setback depth shall be increased by an additional one-half (½) foot of rear setback depth for each additional one (1) foot of lot depth over one hundred (100) feet, up to a maximum rear setback depth of twenty (20) feet. 14. See Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits and Section 17.108.020 for increased height limits in certain situations. 15. See applicable design review criteria for more specific bulk standards. 16. Off-street parking and loading shall be provided as prescribed in the off-street parking and loading

Also, additional parking standards apply within the S-11 and S-12 Zones, as prescribed in Chapter 17.92 and Chapter 17.94. 17. Usable open space is only required on lots with two (2) or more primary living units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. Each one (1) square foot of private usable open space equals two (2) square feet towards the total usable open space requirement, except that actual group space shall be provided in the minimum amount specified in the table per dwelling unit, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. All usable open space shall meet the standards contained in Chapter 17.126. 18. See Section 17.103.085 for setback and separation requirements for Vehicular Residential Facilities. 19. Maximum Lot Coverage and maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) only apply to lots with one to --- Page 128 --- OAKLAND 128 two dwelling units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. See Table 17.15.05 for applicable regulations. 20. Except as stated below in this limitation, the minimum front setback shall be reduced to five (5) feet for the following facilities: a. New principal buildings that include

--- Chunk 230 ---
ground floor Commercial Facilities; and b. New Commercial Facilities located to the front of a Potential Designated Historic Property (PDHP) or Designated Historic Property (DHP), but only if the height of the new Commercial Facility in the area between the front property line and the front building elevation of the existing historic structure does not exceed fifteen (15) feet. No front or side setback is required for existing Commercial Facilities. Also, no front yard setback is required for new Commercial Facilities if there is an existing context within the adjoining block face of no front yard setback. For the purposes of this limitation, an “existing context” of no front yard setback means that at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing buildings from street corner to street corner on the same side of the street have no front yard setback. 21. For developments involving the creation of new units on two or more adjoining parcels under the same ownership, there is no minimum interior side setback required between those new units. --- Page 129 --- OAKLAND 129 B.

required interior side and rear setbacks on a lot containing two (2) or more living units and opposite a legally-required living room window. 10. In all RM Zones, on every corner lot which abuts to the rear a key lot which is in a Residential Zone, there shall be provided on the street side of such corner lot a side setback with a minimum width equal to one-half (½) of the minimum front setback depth required on the key lot and no less than the minimum side setback width required along an interior side lot line of the corner lot. However, such side setback shall only apply to the rear ten (10) feet of the corner lot, and not be required to exceed four (4) feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot. Such setback shall be provided unobstructed except for the accessory structures or the other facilities allowed therein by Section 17.108.130. This regulation does not apply to lots within the C Combining Zone (see Illustration for Table 17.17.03 [Additional Regulation 10], below). See also Subsection 17.110.040.C for special controls on location of detached accessory buildings on

Each one (1) square foot of private usable open space equals two (2) square feet towards the total usable open space requirement, except that actual group space shall be provided in the minimum amount specified in the table per dwelling unit, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. All usable open space shall meet the standards contained in Chapter 17.126. --- Page 151 --- OAKLAND 151 17. This regulation does not apply in the C Combining Zone. 18. See Section 17.103.085 for setback and separation requirements for Vehicular Residential Facilities. 19. Maximum Lot Coverage and maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) only apply to lots with one to two dwelling units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. See Table 17.17.05 for applicable regulations. 20. This height is only required for new principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and is measured from the sidewalk grade to the second story floor. If the Nonresidential Facility is to be located to the front of a Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) or Designated Historic Property (DHP),

--- Chunk 261 ---
this height shall also be the maximum allowed for a Nonresidential Facility in the area between the front property line and the front building elevation of the existing historic structure. 21. For developments involving the creation of new units on two or more adjoining parcels under the same ownership, there is no minimum interior side setback between those new units. B. Reduced Setbacks for Smaller Lots. Table 17.17.04 below prescribes reduced setback standards for lots less than three thousand (3,000) square feet. The number designations in the "Additional Regulations" column refer to the regulations listed at the end of the Table.

floor Nonresidential Facilities; and b. New Nonresidential Commercial Facilities associated with a Potential Designated Historic Property (PDHP) or Designated Historic Property (DHP), but only if there is an existing context within the adjoining block face of no front and/or side yard setback. For the purposes of this limitation, an “existing context” of no front or side yard setback means that at least sixty percent (60%) of the existing buildings from street corner to street corner --- Page 152 --- OAKLAND 152 on the same side of the street have no front or side yard setback. If the Commercial Facility is to be located to the front of a PDHP or DHP, the maximum height allowed for the portion of the Commercial Facility between the sidewalk and the existing structure shall be fifteen (15) feet. A side yard of the normally required minimum width in Table 17.17.04 shall be required for new construction or addition along any side lot line abutting an interior side lot line of any lot that is not located in a C Combining Zone or Commercial Zone. (Where it abuts a rear lot line, no yard is required). Section 17.108.080 still applies. Also, see Section 17.106.010 for

When the rear yard of a reversed corner lot abuts a key lot that is in an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required street side yard setback in the rear ten(10) feet of the reversed corner lot is one-half (½) of the minimum front yard required on the key lot, but shall not be required to exceed four (4) feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot (see Illustration for Table 17.19.03 [Additional Regulation 9], below). Illustration for Table 17.19.03 [Additional Regulation 9] *for illustration purposes only --- Page 170 --- OAKLAND 170 10. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback actually on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section

--- Chunk 290 ---
17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 11. When a rear lot line in the RU-4 or RU-5 Zones is adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback for both Residential and Nonresidential Facilities is ten (10) feet. When a rear lot line of a lot in these zones is not adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback is ten (10) feet for Residential Facilities and there is no required setback for Nonresidential Facilities. 12. This height is only required for new principal buildings with ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and is measured from the sidewalk grade to the second story floor. 13. This regulation only applies to new Residential Facilities and ground floor living space located within fifteen (15) feet of a street frontage. 14. Buildings in the RU Zones shall have a thirty (30) foot maximum height at the setback line associated with any rear or interior side lot line that abut a lot in an RH, RD, or RM Zone; if the principal building on the abutting lot has a height of thirty (30) feet or less, this maximum height shall increase one (1) foot for every foot of distance

--- Chunk 291 ---
from this setback line. If the principal building on the abutting lot has a height of greater than thirty (30) feet, the maximum height shall increase two (2) feet for every foot away from the applicable setback line (see Illustration for Table 17.19.03 [Additional Regulation 14], below). Also, see Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits and Section 17.108.020 for increased height limits in certain situations. --- Page 171 --- OAKLAND 171 Illustration for Table 17.19.03 [Additional Regulation 14] *for illustration purposes only 15.

For the new construction of principal buildings in the RU-4 and RU-5 Zones, access to parking and loading facilities through driveways, garage doors, or other means shall not be from the principal street when alternative access is feasible from another location such as a secondary frontage or an alley. Where this is not feasible, every reasonable effort shall be made to share means of vehicular access with abutting properties. Open parking areas shall not be located between the sidewalk and a principal building. 19. Usable open space is only required on lots with two (2) or more dwelling

--- Chunk 293 ---
units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units.

Maximum yards apply to seventy-five percent (75%) of the street frontage on the principal street and fifty percent (50%) on other streets, if any. All percentages, however, may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) upon the granting of Regular Design Review approval (see Chapter 17.136 for the design review procedure). In addition to the criteria contained in Section 17.136.050, the proposal to reduce to fifty percent (50%) must also meet each of the following criteria: i. The additional yard area abutting the principal street is designed to accommodate publicly accessible plazas, sidewalk cafes, or restaurants; ii. The proposal will not impair a generally continuous wall of building facades; --- Page 193 --- OAKLAND 193 iii. The proposal will not weaken the concentration and continuity of retail facilities at ground-level, and will not impair the retention or creation of an important shopping frontage; and iv. The proposal will not interfere with the movement of people along an important pedestrian street. 4. Wherever an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line of any lot located in an RH or

--- Chunk 321 ---
RD Zone, a side setback of six (6) feet is required. In the case where an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line in a RM Zone, the setback of the abutting portion of its side lot line is five (5) feet. In the case where an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line of any lot located in an RU-1 or RU-2 Zone, a side setback of four (4) feet is required (see Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 4], below). Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 4] *for illustration purposes only 5.

feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot (see Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 6], below). Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. --- Page 194 --- OAKLAND 194 Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 6] *for illustration purposes only 7. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback actually on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 8. When a rear lot line is adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback for both Residential and Nonresidential Facilities is ten (10) feet. When a rear lot line is not adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback is ten (10) feet for Residential Facilities and there is no required setback for Nonresidential Facilities. 9. This percentage of transparency is only required for principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and only applies

--- Chunk 323 ---
to the facade facing the principal street. The regulations only apply to facades located within twenty (20) feet of a street frontage. The area of required transparency is between two (2) feet and nine (9) feet in height of the ground floor and must be comprised of clear, nonreflective windows that allow views out of indoor activity space or lobbies (see Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 9], below). Areas required for garage doors shall not be included in the calculation of facade area (see Additional Regulation 12 for limitations on the location of parking access). Glass block does not qualify as a transparent window. Exceptions to this regulation may be allowed by the Planning Director for unique facilities such as convention centers, gymnasiums, parks, gas stations, theaters and other similar facilities. --- Page 195 --- OAKLAND 195 Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 9] *for illustration purposes only 10.

The following notes apply to the maximum front yard requirement: --- Page 212 --- OAKLAND 212 a. The requirements only apply to the construction of new principal buildings; and if multiple new principal buildings are to be constructed on a lot, the requirements only apply to the building(s) that can be reasonably sited along the street frontage(s). b. The requirements do not apply to lots containing the following principal activities: Recreational Assembly, Community Education, Utility and Vehicular, or Extensive Impact Civic Activities or Automobile and Other Light Vehicle Gas Station and Servicing Commercial Activities as principal activities. c. Maximum yards apply to seventy-five percent (75%) of the street frontage on the principal street and fifty percent (50%) on other streets, if any. All percentages, however, may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) upon the granting of Regular Design Review (see Chapter 17.136 for the design review procedure). In addition to the criteria contained in Section 17.136.050, a proposal to reduce to fifty percent (50%) the amount of street frontage that maximum yards would apply to must also meet each of the following

--- Chunk 348 ---
criteria: i. The additional yard area abutting the principal street is designed to accommodate publicly accessible plazas, sidewalk cafes, or restaurants; ii. The proposal will not impair a generally continuous wall of building facades; iii. The proposal will not weaken the concentration and continuity of retail facilities at ground-level, and will not impair the retention or creation of an important shopping frontage; and iv. The proposal will not interfere with the movement of people along an important pedestrian street. 4. Wherever an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line of any lot located in an RH or RD Zone, a side setback of six (6) feet is required. In the case where an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line in an RM Zone, the setback of the abutting portion of its side lot line is five (5) feet. In the case where an interior side lot line abuts an interior side lot line of any lot located in an RU-1 or RU-2 Zone, a side setback of four (4) feet is required (see Illustration for Table 17.35.03 [Additional Regulation 4], below). Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. --- Page 213

When the rear yard of a reversed corner lot abuts a key lot that is in an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required street side yard setback in the rear ten (10) feet of the reversed corner lot is one-half (½) of the minimum front yard required on the key lot, but shall not be required to exceed four (4) feet in width if it would reduce to less than twenty-five (25) feet the buildable width of any corner lot (see Illustration for Table 17.33.03 [Additional Regulation 6], below). Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into the setbacks. --- Page 214 --- OAKLAND 214 Illustration for Table 17.35.03 [Additional Regulation 6] *for illustration purposes only 7. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback actually

--- Chunk 350 ---
on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 8. When a rear lot line is adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback for both Residential and Nonresidential Facilities is ten (10) feet. When a rear lot line is not adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback is ten (10) feet for Residential Facilities and there is no required setback for Nonresidential Facilities. 9. This percentage of transparency is only required for principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and only applies to facades facing the principal street. The regulations only apply to facades located within twenty (20) feet of a street frontage. The area of required transparency is between two (2) feet and nine (9) feet in height of the ground floor and must be comprised of clear, non-reflective windows that allow views out of indoor activity space or lobbies (see Illustration for Table 17.35.03 [Additional Regulation 9], below). Areas required for garage doors shall not be included in the calculation of facade area (see Additional Regulation 12 for limitations on the location

of parking access). Glass block does not qualify as a transparent window. Exceptions to this regulation may be allowed by the Planning Director for unique facilities such as convention centers, gymnasiums, parks, gas stations, theaters and other similar facilities. --- Page 215 --- OAKLAND 215 Illustration for Table 17.35.03 [Additional Regulation 9] *for illustration purposes only 10. This height is only required for new principal buildings with ground floor Nonresidential Facilities located within twenty (20) feet of the principal street frontage; and is measured from the sidewalk grade to the second story floor. 11. For the construction of new principal buildings in the CC-2 Zone, access to parking and loading facilities through driveways, garage doors, or other means shall not be from the principal street when alternative access is feasible from another location such as a secondary frontage or an alley. Where this is not feasible, every reasonable effort shall be made to share means of vehicular access with abutting properties. Open parking areas shall not be located between the sidewalk and a principal building. 12. For the construction of new principal buildings in the CC-2 Zone, ground level parking spaces, locker areas, mechanical rooms, and other non-active spaces shall

--- Chunk 352 ---
not be located within thirty (30) feet of the principal street frontage, except for incidental entrances to such activities elsewhere in the building. Exceptions to this regulation may be permitted by the Planning Director for non-active spaces that cannot be feasibly placed in other locations of the building. Driveways, garage entrances, or other access to parking and loading facilities may be located on the ground floor of this area as regulated by Additional Regulation 11, above. 13. See Section 17.103.080 for additional parking regulations that apply to Accessory Dwelling Units. 14. Vehicular Residential Facilities shall be located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the street or be located behind a building. See Section 17.103.085 for setback and separation requirements for Vehicular Residential Facilities. B. Height, Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Density, and Open Space.

The intent of the CIX-1A, CIX-1B, CIX-1C, and CIX-1D Industrial Zones is to implement the West Oakland Specific Plan. These and the other CIX, IG, and IO Industrial Zones are intended to create, preserve, and enhance areas for industrial uses, including manufacturing, scientific and product-related research and development, construction, transportation, warehousing/storage/distribution, recycling/waste-related activities, clean technology, and similar uses. The primary purposes of these areas are to support Oakland's economic base and to provide employment opportunities. The specific purposes of the CIX, IG, and IO

--- Chunk 449 ---
Industrial Zones are to: 1. Provide a diversified economic base and a wide range of employment opportunities; 2. Maximize Oakland's regional role as a transportation, distribution, and communications hub; 3. Support Port operations and expansion by providing land for Port services such as trucking, warehousing, and distribution; 4. Preserve areas with good freeway, rail, seaport, and/or airport access for business and industrial uses; 5. Prohibit residential uses and limit commercial uses in General Industrial (IG) areas so that a maximum amount of the City's land base is preserved for industrial uses, and so that industrial uses may operate without impacting those activities; --- Page 282 --- OAKLAND 282 6. Locate high impact industrial uses away from residential areas; and 7. Allow heavy-impact or large-scale commercial retail uses on sites with direct access to the regional transportation system. A. Description of Zones. This Chapter establishes land use regulations for the following zones: 1. CIX-1 Commercial Industrial Mix - 1 Industrial Zone. The CIX-1 Zone is intended to create, preserve, and enhance industrial areas that are appropriate for a wide variety of businesses and related commercial and industrial establishments.

The intent of the S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by ensuring that activities and facilities that are located, in whole or part, within or adjacent to Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZs) as designated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and accessed from streets that are less than twenty-six (26) feet in width at any point or cul-de-sacs that do not meet emergency access standards, develop in such a manner as not to be a serious threat to public health

--- Chunk 531 ---
or safety. S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone is mapped using the following criteria: A. Lots located, in whole or part, within or adjacent to VHFHSZs and one of the following criteria is met: B. The lot is accessed by streets connecting the lot to the nearest arterial street (as designated by the City of Oakland General Plan Land Use and Transportation Element) with a pavement width of less than twenty-six (26) feet at any point; or C. Where a lot is located on a dead-end street that has a total length of six hundred (600) feet or longer from the nearest intersection. For the purposes of this Subsection, the total length of a dead-end street shall be the distance from the intersection with the nearest through street to the farthest opposite end of the street right-of-way, or private access easement (as defined by Section 16.32.010 of the Oakland Municipal Code) if the shared access facility/private access easement is connected to said dead-end street. 17.88.020 Findings. A. Portions of Oakland that are within the VHFHSZ include areas of Oakland Hills that suffered from the devastating Oakland firestorm in 1991. B. California’s fire risk appears to grow each year as a

--- Chunk 532 ---
result of the climate change with higher temperatures and an increase in drought conditions. C. Evolving data from recent wildfires display new extreme fire behavior not observed by the OFD previously. D. During recent wildfires in California people perished in their cars on blocked roads because they could not escape in time. E. New mapping and evacuation software management tools available to Oakland Fire Department (OFD) show that current road and intersection capacity in VHFHSZ is not adequate for the existing population in the events of mass emergency evacuations, additional units and vehicles within the VHFHSZ will increase the evacuation problem. --- Page 337 --- OAKLAND 337 F. OFD indicates that roads within VHFHSZ are likely to develop “choke points” during emergency evacuations, thereby blocking the free flow of traffic throughout the VHFHSZ. G. Physical dimensions of streets (width and cul-de-sac length) along with the number of vehicles in VHFHSZ are the two largest factors during emergency evacuations that contribute to developing of the “choke points.” H. Streets that are less than twenty-six (26) feet wide or dead-end streets that are longer than six hundred (600) feet do not meet minimum emergency access standards as specified in Municipal Code Section

--- Chunk 533 ---
16.16.025(C)(1), and are at high risk of being blocked during emergency evacuations as well as blocking access for emergency vehicles to respond to emergencies. I. Oakland Local Hazard Mitigation Plan points out existing vulnerable and isolated populations in VHFHSZ areas. J. Oakland Vegetation Management Report underscores the fact that the area within the VHFHSZ is susceptible to large-scale, high intensity, and rapidly spreading wildfires because of the VHFHSZ unique combination of topography, vegetation, prolonged droughts, winds, and other climatic conditions. 17.88.030 Definitions. For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions apply: A. Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones are identified by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) within Local Responsibility Areas (LRA), including the City of Oakland. Mapping of Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) is based on data and models of potential fuels over a given time horizon and their associated expected fire behavior and burn probabilities to quantify the likelihood of vegetation fire exposure to buildings. 17.88.040 Zones with which the S-9 Zone may be combined. The S-9 Zone may be combined with any other zone. 17.88.050 Prohibited land uses. The following land use activities or

--- Chunk 534 ---
facilities are prohibited within the S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone: A. The following Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) as defined in Sections 17.09.040 and 17.103.080: 1. One Family, Two- to Four-Family, and Multifamily Category One Accessory Dwelling Units that are conversions of space outside the envelope of an existing Residential Facility; 2. More than one Two- to Four-Family or, Multifamily Category One Accessory Dwelling Unit that is within the existing envelope of an existing Residential Facility per lot; 3. One Family, Two- to Four-Family, and Multifamily Category Two Accessory Dwelling Units; 4. Two- to Four-Family and Multifamily Category Three Accessory Dwelling Units. --- Page 338 --- OAKLAND 338 B. Except for one (1) ADU specified in 1, 2, or 3 above is allowed in lieu of a Category One interior ADU if the following conditions are met: 1. At least one (1) additional off-street parking space is created on the lot for the ADU in addition to any regularly required off-street parking spaces for the primary Residential Facility. Also, any lost parking spaces must be replaced on the lot; or 2. Approved application for Reasonable Accommodation Request pursuant to Chapter 17.131 due to a disability of an ADU occupant or

--- Chunk 535 ---
a need to accommodate a live-in caregiver for a person with disability. The Reasonable Accommodation Request must include a reason for the exception. No additional ADU parking is required, but any lost parking spaces must be replaced elsewhere on the lot. --- Page 339 --- OAKLAND 339 Chapter 17.90 S-10 SCENIC ROUTE COMBINING ZONE REGULATIONS Sections: 17.90.010 Title, purpose, and applicability. 17.90.020 Zones with which the S-10 Zone may be combined. 17.90.030 Required design review process. 17.90.040 Restriction on driveway access. 17.90.050 Design review criteria. 17.90.060 Restriction on subdivisions in the Shepherd Canyon Corridor. 17.90.070 Restriction of height on downslope lots. 17.90.080 Conditional use permit for waiver of certain requirements in the Shepherd Canyon Corridor. 17.90.010 Title, purpose, and applicability.

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the S-13 Affordable Housing Combining Zone Regulations. The Affordable Housing Combining (S-13) Zone is intended to create and preserve affordable housing restricted for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and/or moderate- income households, (as defined in California Health and Safety Code Sections 50093, 50105, and 50106 and in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040). These

--- Chunk 560 ---
regulations shall apply in the S-13 Zone and are supplementary to the regulations applying in the base zones with which the S-13 Zone is combined. Where conflict between the standards set forth in the S-13 Combining Zone and the underlying zoning district exists, the provisions in this chapter shall govern for qualifying developments. The S-13 Combining Zone is an optional program and applicants not opting to use the S-13 Zone provisions shall not be subjected to the standards set forth in this chapter. The provisions in this Chapter are distinguished from, and are mutually exclusive of, other development bonuses available pursuant to Chapter 17.107 - Density Bonus and Incentive Procedure and State Density Bonus Law under Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 4.3 of the California Government Code. Developers may apply to utilize either the provisions under Chapter 17.107 and Government Code Chapter 4.3, or this chapter, but not both. Also, the provisions in this chapter cannot be combined with any local zoning incentive program. The purpose of the S-13 Combining Zone is to allow a bonus height for eligible affordable housing projects, as well as relaxation of other listed development standards for applicable zones and an elimination of any maximum

--- Chunk 561 ---
residential density standards. One hundred percent (100%) affordable housing projects in the S-13 Zone shall receive By Right Residential Approval (as defined in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040) if it meets all the standards set forth in this chapter in place of the requirements otherwise applicable in the base zones. Any development not meeting all of the standards set forth in the S-13 Combining Zone shall be subject to the requirements otherwise applicable in the underlying zoning district. 17.95.020 Affordability Thresholds By Right Residential Approval under the S-13 Combining Zone shall apply to developments that include one hundred percent (100%) affordable housing units, other than manager’s units, --- Page 353 --- OAKLAND 353 (as defined in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040), restricted to extremely low-, very low-, low-, and/or moderate-income households (as defined in California Health and Safety Code Sections 50093, 50105, and 50106, and in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040). Projects proposing to utilize the By Right Residential Approval provisions in this chapter on a parcel less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet must provide affordable housing units that meet the following criteria: (A) At least twenty percent (20%) of the housing units are restricted to very low-income or

--- Chunk 562 ---
lower-income households; and (B) At least twenty percent (20%) of the housing units are restricted to moderate-income households. 17.95.030 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this chapter only: (A) Incentive. "Incentive" has the same meaning as provided in California Government Code Section 65915 and shall mean a reduction in site development standards, or a modification to a requirement of the Oakland Planning Code so long as the requested reduction or modification both exceeds the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission that would otherwise be required and results in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable rent or affordable housing costs. Incentives do not include the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of City-owned land or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements, the modification of any City of Oakland Standard Conditions of Approval, or modification of any mitigation measures required by the California Environmental Quality Act. 17.95.040 Zones with which the S-13 Zone may be combined. The S-13 Zone may be combined with any Residential or Commercial Zone, except S-9 as shown on the city zoning map. 17.95.050 Exemptions from the S-13 Zone. The following sites are

--- Chunk 563 ---
exempt from the S-13 Combining Zone and are not eligible for the approval process or relaxation of development standards described in this chapter: A. Parcels in the S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone; and B. Parcels with Designated City, State, and National Historic Landmarks. Parcels in Historic Districts that are designated Areas of Primary Importance (API) as of the adoption date of the 2023-2031 Housing Element (January 31, 2023) remain eligible for the approval process described in this chapter, including the elimination of maximum residential density standards, but are not eligible for and shall not receive the higher height limit allowance, reduced setback allowance, or relaxed maximum lot coverage allowance. Developments in designated API Historic Districts must still meet the height, setback, and maximum lot coverage --- Page 354 --- OAKLAND 354 requirements in the underlying zoning district, and any existing structure cannot be demolished as part of a qualifying project. The development must also meet the applicable objective design review standards for historic buildings. 17.95.060 Property Development Standards. The S-13 Combining Zone shall apply as shown on the city zoning map. When an applicant or developer elects to utilize the S-13 Zone for projects with affordable deed-restricted housing consistent

--- Chunk 564 ---
with the thresholds provided in Section 17.95.020, the development standards prescribed in Table 17.95.01 shall apply. Where conflict between the standards set forth in the S- 13 Combining Zone and the underlying zoning district exists, the provisions in this chapter shall govern for qualifying developments. Table 17.95.01 Property Development Standards within the S-13 Affordable Housing Combining Zone Development Standards Permitted Density Unlimited residential density that fits within the allowed building envelope of new or existing structures. Rear Setback Ten (10) feet. Maximum Lot Coverage Seventy percent (70%) or whatever is allowed in the base zone, whichever is higher.

Minimum Parking No minimum parking requirements. 17.95.070 Additional Incentives. In addition to the automatic relaxation of property development standards as described in Section 17.95.060 an applicant utilizing the By Right Residential Approval under this chapter for a qualifying affordable housing project may submit to the city a

--- Chunk 565 ---
proposal for up to three additional development incentives that contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of affordable housing. The requested incentive(s) shall not pertain to the allowable height or setbacks of the proposal but may otherwise pertain to any applicable objective development standard in the Planning Code. The applicant must include in the incentive proposal --- Page 355 --- OAKLAND 355 documentation that the granting of the incentive provides identifiable and actual cost reductions to the project. Incentive requests complying with the requirements of this section shall be granted unless the City establishes that the incentive would have a specific adverse impact on public health and safety or would be contrary to state or federal law. --- Page 356 --- OAKLAND 356 Chapter 17.96 S-14 HOUSING SITES COMBINING ZONE REGULATIONS Sections: 17.96.010 Title, Purpose and Applicability. 17.96.020 Definitions. 17.96.030 Zones with which the S-14 Zone may be combined. 17.96.040 Required Majority Residential Use. 17.96.050 Minimum Densities. 17.96.060 By Right Approval for Sites Identified in Prior Housing Element Cycles. 17.96.070 By Right Approval for Sites not Identified in Prior Housing Elements. 17.96.010 Title, Purpose and Applicability.

The Housing Sites Combining (S-14) Zone is intended to facilitate housing production on those sites that the City identified for housing pursuant to the 2023-2031 Housing Element. The S-14 Combining Zone seeks to ensure that sites within the S-14 Zone are developed with residential uses; and that projects that contribute toward meeting Oakland’s needs for lower income housing receive By Right Residential Approval (as defined in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040). These regulations shall apply in the S-14 Combining Zone and where so stated herein shall supersede the regulations applying in the underlying zoning district with which the S-14 Zone is combined. 17.96.020 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this Chapter only. Housing Sites Inventory. “Housing Sites Inventory” shall mean those sites listed in Tables C-5a, C-5b, and C-26 (Sheets “Table A” and “Table B”) included in Appendix C of the City of Oakland 2023-2031 Housing Element. Majority Residential Use. “Majority Residential Use” shall mean a use consisting of residential units only, mixed use developments consisting of residential and non-residential uses with at least two-thirds of the square footage designated for residential activity, or transitional or supportive housing. Prior Housing Element Sites. “Prior Housing Element

--- Chunk 567 ---
Sites” shall mean those sites included in the Housing Sites Inventory and also included in the previously adopted 2007-2014 or 2015- 2023 Housing Elements, as identified in column O of Table C-26 of the City of Oakland 2023- 2031 Housing Element as either “Used in Prior Housing Element – Non-Vacant” or “Used in Two Consecutive Prior Housing Elements – Vacant.” --- Page 357 --- OAKLAND 357 Realistic Capacity. “Realistic Capacity” shall mean the projected residential development capacity, stated in terms of total probable number of dwelling units, capable of being achieved on the sites identified in the Housing Sites Inventory. If the site is included in Sheet “Table A” of Table C-26, then the Realistic Capacity is identified in column S, “Total Capacity.” If the site is included in Table C-5a, Table C-5b, or Sheet “Table B” of Table C-26, then the Realistic Capacity is the sum total of columns identifying the capacity of Extremely Low Income, Very Low Income, Low Income, Moderate Income, and Above Moderate Income, expressed as total dwelling unit count. Where a site is designated in the Housing Sites Inventory as part of a consolidated site grouping, with the Realistic Capacity listed on only a subset

--- Chunk 568 ---
of the consolidated sites, the Realistic Capacity for the site shall be proportional to the parcel size compared to the aggregated parcel size for the associated consolidated sites, rounded to the nearest whole number. 17.96.030 Zones with which the S-14 Zone may be combined. The S-14 Zone may be combined with any other zone. The S-14 Combining Zone shall apply to all parcels identified in the Housing Sites Inventory, with specified sections applicable to Prior Housing Element Sites. The City shall maintain a mapping resource of parcels included in the Housing Sites Inventory, including Prior Housing Element Sites, that will be available to the public. However, the Housing Sites Inventory included in the 2023-2031 Housing Element shall be the definitive source for determining whether a parcel is included within the S-14 Combining Zone. 17.96.040 Required Majority Residential Use. All development projects proposed in the S-14 Combining Zone must be a Majority Residential Use. Any development project proposed in the S-14 Combining Zone not providing a Majority Residential Use shall not be permitted. Notwithstanding the above, a development project proposed in the S-14 Combining Zone that is not a Majority Residential Use may be permitted if the applicant can demonstrate one

--- Chunk 569 ---
of the following: A. The proposal includes a total residential unit count that equals no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Realistic Capacity designated for the site as shown in the Housing Sites Inventory; B. The proposal is a non-residential development that is coordinated with the development of a site under the same ownership that is within ¼ mile of the proposed development’s site and that when the square footage of both developments are considered together meets the definition of a Majority Residential Use. For purposes of this section, “coordinated” shall mean that the Realistic Capacity applicable to the non-residential development will be applied to the newly identified site for purposes of determining minimum densities under Section 17.96.050, and the developer of the proposed non-residential development has either applied for planning entitlements for --- Page 358 --- OAKLAND 358 the residential development or has entered into an agreement, provided to the City, for partnered housing with a residential developer. Such agreement shall identify the Realistic Capacity and minimum density for the site and identify how the non- residential developer will contribute to affordable housing. The development standards applicable to the residential site must be sufficient to accommodate the

--- Chunk 570 ---
applied Realistic Capacity. Affordable housing may be contributed by the non-residential developer through the donation of the property to the residential developer or through a cash payment to the residential developer that shall be used toward the cost of constructing the residential project. If a building permit has not been issued for the residential development, the City may withhold issuance of building permits for the non-residential development until building permits for the residential development are issued. If the residential development does not commence construction, the City may withhold certificates of occupancy for the non-residential development until the construction of the residential development is commenced. C. The proposal is a use on government-owned property that is not a disposition under the Surplus Lands Act or that is otherwise exempt from the Surplus Lands Act. Notwithstanding Section 17.96.050, such uses are also exempt from minimum residential density requirements. D. The proposal is an Emergency Shelter Residential Activity and/or Emergency Housing Facility permitted pursuant to Section 17.07.060.A. 17.96.050 Minimum Densities. All development projects proposed in the S-14 Combining Zone must comply with the minimum residential density requirements described in this section. Any project proposed in the S-14 Zone not providing the minimum required

--- Chunk 571 ---
residential density shall not be permitted. All projects proposed in the S-14 Combining Zone shall include a residential unit count that equals no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Realistic Capacity designated for the site as shown in the Housing Sites Inventory. Notwithstanding the above, a proposed development in which one hundred percent (100%) of the residential units are reserved for moderate-, low-, and very low-income households, other than manager’s units, may propose a residential unit count that is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Realistic Capacity designated for the site so long as the residential unit count equals no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the lower income capacity for the site as shown in the Housing Sites Inventory. 17.96.060 By Right Residential Approval for Prior Housing Element Sites. If a project is proposed on a Prior Housing Element Sites parcel and at least twenty percent (20%) of the project’s units will be made available to lower-income households, the project shall be subject to By Right Residential Approval, as defined in Oakland Planning Code Section 17.09.040. 17.96.070 By Right Residential Approval for Sites not used in Prior Housing Elements. If a project is proposed on a

--- Chunk 572 ---
parcel included in the Housing Sites Inventory and is not a Prior Housing Element Sites parcel, the project shall be subject to By Right Residential Approval if the project proposes at least as many lower- and moderate-income units as shown in the Housing --- Page 359 --- OAKLAND 359 Sites Inventory, the project overall proposes at least as many total units as described as the Realistic Capacity for the parcel, and the project satisfies at least one of the following conditions: A. At least twenty percent (20% of the total housing units are restricted to very low- income households; B. At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total housing units are restricted to any combination of very low- and lower-income households; C. At least forty percent (40%) of the total housing units are restricted to any combination of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Notwithstanding the above, a project shall not be eligible for By Right Residential Approval under this section if the project proposes development in phases or proposes more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of floor area, unless one hundred percent (100%) of the housing units, other than manager’s units, are restricted to very low-, low-

--- Chunk 573 ---
and moderate-income residents. FOOTNOTE(S): --- (36) --- Editor's note— Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh.

District Combining Zone Regulations. The Historic Preservation District Combining (S-20) Zone is intended to preserve and enhance the cultural, educational, aesthetic, environmental, and economic value of structures, other physical facilities, sites, and areas of special importance due to historical association, basic architectural merit, the embodiment of a style or special type of construction, or other special character, interest, or value, and is typically appropriate to selected older locations in the city. The S-20 Zone is similar to the S-7 Preservation Combining Zone, but is designed for larger areas, often with a large number of residential properties that may not be individually eligible for landmark designation but which as a whole constitute a historic district. The S-20 Zone provides generally more expeditious review procedures than those provided in the S-7 Zone. These regulations shall apply in the S-20 Zone, and are supplementary to the provisions of Section 17.136.070 for designated landmarks and to the other regulations applying in the zones with which the S-20 Zone is combined; if a property is both a landmark and located in the S-20 Zone and is therefore subject to both landmark and S-20 regulations, the stricter regulations prevail.

Except for projects that are exempt from design review as set forth in Section 17.136.025, no Building Facility (see Section 17.09.040 for definition), Designated Historic Property, Potentially Designated Historic Property, Telecommunications Facility, Sign, or other associated structure shall be constructed, established, or altered in exterior appearance, unless plans for the proposal have been approved pursuant to the design review procedure --- Page 391 --- OAKLAND 391 in Chapter 17.136, and when applicable, the additional provisions in Sections 17.100B.050, 17.100B.060, and 17.100B.070, the Telecommunications regulations in Chapter 17.128, or the Sign regulations in Chapter 17.104. B. See Section 17.136.075 for design review criteria for the demolition or removal of Designated Historic Properties and Potentially Designated

--- Chunk 618 ---
Historic Properties. C. Landmarks Referral. If an application is for regular design review in the S-20 Zone, and the Director of City Planning determines that a proposed addition or alteration will have a significant effect on the property's character-defining elements that are visible from a street or other public area, the Director may, at his or her discretion, refer the project to the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board for its recommendations. "Character-defining elements" are those features of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location, and association that identify a property as representative of its period and contribute to its visual distinction or historical significance. An addition or alteration is normally considered "visible from a street or other public area" if it affects a street face or public face of the facility or is otherwise located within the "critical design area," defined as the area within forty (40) feet of any street line, public alley, public path, park or other public area.

In the S-20 Zone, proposals requiring Regular design review approval pursuant to Section 17.100B.030 may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the Regular design review criteria set forth in the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136 and to all of the following additional criteria: A. That the proposal will not substantially impair the visual, architectural, or historic value of the affected site or facility. Consideration shall be given to design, form, scale, color, materials, texture, lighting, detailing and ornamentation, landscaping, signs, and any other relevant design element or effect, and, where applicable, the relation of the above to the original design of the affected facility. B. That the proposed development will not substantially impair the visual, architectural, or historic value of the total setting or character of the S-20 Historic Preservation Zone or of neighboring facilities. Consideration shall be given to the desired overall character of any such area or grouping of facilities, including all design elements or effects specified in Subsection (A) above; and C.

purpose, and applicability. A. The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the D-OTN Oak to Ninth District Zone Regulations. B. The "Zoning Regulations and Standards for Development and Use of Property within the Oak to Ninth Mixed Use Development" which are attached to Ordinance 12758 C.M.S, and as amended in Section 17.101B.020, shall apply to the area designated in Ordinance 12759 C.M.S. C. This Chapter establishes land use regulations and development standards for the Oak-To- Ninth Mixed Use Development, now known as Brooklyn Basin. The approximately 63.82- acre site is bounded by Embarcadero Road, the Oakland Estuary, Fallon Street, and 10th Avenue, and includes the Clinton Basin Marina and the Fifth Avenue Marina, but does not include Fifth Avenue Point. D. The 63.82-acre Oak to Ninth District (Brooklyn Basin) area is governed by the following set of regulations: the regulations set forth in this Chapter; Chapter 17.11 – OS Open Space zoning regulations for Open Space Region-Serving Park (OS-RSP); the Preliminary --- Page 405 --- OAKLAND 405 Development Plan dated February 2006 and approved on June 20, 2006, amended on November 5, 2014 and amended on May 16, 2023 Oak to Ninth Design Guidelines amended on November 5,

--- Chunk 638 ---
2014; Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 7621 dated March 8, 2006 and approved on June 20, 2006; Conditions of Approval approved on June 20, 2006, amended on May 17, 2017 and on May 16, 2023; the Mitigation Monitoring Reporting Program approved on June 20, 2006, and the Development Agreement approved on June 20, 2006, amended on May 16, 2023. The specific purposes of the D-OTN Oak To Ninth District Zone are to: A. Encourage the creation of a mixed-use district that integrates a combination of residential, commercial, public open space and civic uses. B. Establish development standards that allow residential, commercial, public open space and civic activities to compatibly co-exist. C. Provide a balance of private development and public open space with convenient access to public open space and the waterfront. D. Improve access to the waterfront and recreational opportunities along the waterfront including boat launches and marinas. E. Encourage quality and variety in building and landscape design as well as compatibility in use and form. F. Encourage development that is respectful of the environmental qualities that the site has to offer. The 63.82-acre Oak to Ninth District (Brooklyn Basin Project) area is divided into two major areas; private residential

--- Chunk 639 ---
and commercial development (approximately 34 acres), and public parks, open space, and civic uses (approximately 30 acres), and is assigned two separate zoning districts. Residential and Commercial Uses Oak to Ninth District. The D-OTN Zone is intended to provide mid-rise and high-rise housing opportunities together with ground floor retail and commercial uses. Future development will be set back from the waterfront and will stress compatibility between residential and nonresidential uses and reflect a variety of housing and business types. Public Parks, Open Space, and Civic Uses Open Space – Region Serving Park. The OS-RSP Zone is the area that is designated for public parks, open space, and civic uses. New parks include Shoreline Park, including the remaining portion of the 9th Avenue Terminal, South Park, Channel Park, and Estuary Park. Clinton Basin and the Fifth Avenue Marina are also included in this zoning district. Uses proposed in this zone are regulated by the City of Oakland as Trustee in consultation with the State Lands Commission which retains jurisdiction over Public Trust lands. Notwithstanding the provisions of Municipal Code Chapter 6.04.080, dogs shall be allowed leashed in all public parks and open space areas within the Oak-To-Ninth District (Brooklyn Basin) area

--- Chunk 640 ---
boundaries. Dogs shall be allowed unleashed in the dog park designated in the --- Page 406 --- OAKLAND 406 Final Development Plan. (Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. No. 12999, § 4(Exh. A), 3-16-2010) 17.101B.020 Development Plans and Design Review All development projects within the D-OTN Oak to Ninth District Zone will be processed using a Planned Unit Development permitting process. The approved Preliminary Development Plan dated June 20, 2006, as amended on May 16, 2023, provides the comprehensive development framework for the entire 63.82-acre site. The entire development will be constructed in five phases. Each phase requires submittal and approval of a Final Development Plan. Design Review for each Final Development Plan shall follow the schedule outlined in Chapter 17.136, Design Review Procedure. Each building or structure not submitted with the application for a Final Development Plan will require separate design review approval. Both the Preliminary and Final Development Plans shall be prepared by a professional design team consisting of a registered civil engineer, licensed architect, planner or licensed building designer, and any other qualified professionals that the City may require.

The Broadway Valdez District Specific Plan area is divided into two subareas: the Valdez Triangle and the North End. These regulations shall apply to the Broadway Valdez District (D-BV) Zones. 1. The intent for the Valdez Triangle subarea regulations is to: a. Create a

--- Chunk 666 ---
recognized Oakland destination that provides a mix of uses that contributes to around-the-clock activity with people present both day and night, and on weekdays and weekends. b. Create a destination retail district that addresses the City’s need for comparison goods shopping complemented with local-serving retail, dining, entertainment, office, and service uses. c. Encourage, support, and enhance a mix of small, medium, and large-scale retail, commercial, dining, entertainment, arts, cultural, office, residential, service, public plaza, and visitor uses. d. Encourage and enhance a pedestrian-oriented streetscape with street-fronting retail and complementary dining and entertainment uses. e. Establish a pedestrian, bicycle, and transit-oriented district that accommodates vehicular access. 2. The intent for the North End subarea regulations is to: a. Create an attractive, mixed-use boulevard that links the Downtown and Valdez Triangle areas to the Pill Hill, Piedmont, and North Broadway areas, and is integrated with the adjoining residential and health care-oriented neighborhoods. --- Page 421 --- OAKLAND 421 b. Encourage horizontally or vertically mixed use development that complements the Valdez Triangle and addresses the needs of adjoining and nearby neighborhoods with the potential of serving some regional needs close to Interstate 580. c. Encourage uses that complement and support the adjoining medical

--- Chunk 667 ---
centers, such as professional and medical office uses, medical supplies outlets, and visitor and workforce housing. d. Encourage existing and new automotive sales that incorporate an urban format with a showroom and repair shop providing car storage either in a structured garage or in an off-site location. B. Description of Zones. This Chapter establishes land use regulations for the following four (4) zones: 1. D-BV-1 Broadway Valdez District Retail Priority Sites– 1 Commercial Zone. The intent of the D-BV-1 Zone is to establish Retail Priority Sites in the Broadway Valdez District Specific Plan Area in order to encourage a core of comparison goods retail with a combination of small-, medium-, and large-scale retail stores. Priority Sites 3 and 5 are further divided into subareas a, b, and c and Priority Site 4 into subareas a and b as shown in the Height Area Map. Each Retail Priority Site and subarea will have a specified minimum square footage of retail required prior to Residential or Transient Habitation Activities and Facilities being permitted. 2. D-BV-2 Broadway Valdez District Retail– 2 Commercial Zone. The intent of the D- BV-2 Zone is to create, maintain, and enhance areas of the Broadway Valdez District Specific

--- Chunk 668 ---
Plan Area for ground-level retail, restaurants, entertainment, and art activities with pedestrian-oriented, active storefront uses. Upper-story spaces are intended to be available for a wide range of Office and Residential Activities. 3. D-BV-3 Broadway Valdez District Mixed Use Boulevard– 3 Commercial Zone. The D-BV-3 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas with direct frontage and access along Broadway, 27th Street, Piedmont Avenue, and Harrison Street. A wider range of ground-floor office and other commercial activities are allowed than permitted in the D-BV-2 Zone with upper-story spaces intended to be available for a broad range of Residential, Office, or other Commercial Activities. Mixed uses can either be vertical and/or horizontal. 4. D-BV-4 Broadway Valdez District Mixed Use– 4 Commercial Zone. The D-BV-4 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas that do not front Broadway, 27th Street, Piedmont Avenue, or Harrison Street, and allows the widest range of uses on the ground floor including both residential and commercial businesses. Upper-story spaces are intended to be available for a broad range of Residential or Commercial Activities. C. Description of Combining Zone. This Chapter establishes land use regulations for the following combining zone: 1. N North Large Development Site Combining

--- Chunk 669 ---
Zone. The intent of the N Combining Zone is to encourage more active commercial uses on those sites that have deeper lots that front along Broadway. Incentives for large developments are included. When a primary zone is combined with the N Combining Zone, the N Combining Zone permitted uses supersede those of the primary zone. --- Page 422 --- OAKLAND 422 17.101C.020 - Required design review process.

Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided, however, that the portion of the minimum rear setback actually on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than ten (10) feet. Also, see Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 9. When a rear lot line is adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback for both Residential and Nonresidential Facilities is ten (10) feet. When a rear lot line is not adjacent to an RH, RD, or RM Zone, the required rear setback is ten (10) feet for Residential Facilities and there is no required setback for Nonresidential Facilities. 10. This percentage of transparency is only required for principal buildings that include ground- floor Nonresidential Facilities, and only applies to the facade facing the principal street. The regulations only apply to facades located within twenty (20) feet of a street frontage. The area of required transparency is between two (2) feet and nine (9) feet in height of the ground floor and must be comprised of clear, non-reflective windows that allow

--- Chunk 694 ---
views out of indoor activity space or lobbies (see Illustration for Table 17.101C.03 [Additional Regulation 10], below). Areas required for garage doors shall not be included in the calculation of facade area (see Note 12 for limitations on the location of parking access). Glass block does not qualify as a transparent window. Exceptions to this regulation may be allowed by the Planning Director for unique facilities such as convention centers, gymnasiums, parks, gas stations, theaters, and other similar facilities. --- Page 437 --- OAKLAND 437 Illustration for Table 17.101C.03 [Additional Regulation 10] *for illustration purposes only 11.

These requirements shall supersede those in Chapter 17.126: a. Areas occupied by vents or other structures which do not enhance usability of the space shall not be counted toward the listed dimension. b. Openness. There shall be no obstructions above the space except for devices to enhance its usability, such as pergola or awning structures. There shall be no obstructions over ground-level private usable open space except that not more than --- Page 441 --- OAKLAND 441 fifty percent

--- Chunk 702 ---
(50%) of the space may be covered by a private balcony projecting from a higher story. Above-ground-level private usable open space shall have at least one exterior side open and unobstructed, except for incidental railings or balustrades, for eight (8) feet above its floor level. c. Usability. A surface shall be provided which prevents dust and allows convenient use for outdoor activities. Such surface shall be any practicable combination of lawn, garden, flagstone, wood planking, concrete, asphalt or other serviceable, dust free surfacing. Slope shall not exceed ten percent (10%). Off-street parking and loading areas, driveways, and service areas shall not be counted as usable open space. Adequate safety railings or other protective devices shall be erected whenever necessary for space on a roof, but shall not be more than the minimum height required by the Oakland Building Code. d. Accessibility. Usable open space, other than private usable open space, shall be accessible to all the living units on the lot. It shall be served by any stairway or other accessway qualifying under the Oakland Building Code as an egress facility from a habitable room. Private usable open space may be located anywhere on the lot. Above- ground-level space may

See additional regulations in Table 17.101C.06: Retail Priority Sites: Height, Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Residential Bonus, and Open Space. 2. The following are regulations for retail square footage minimums: a. The following contribute to the retail square footage minimums: i. Retail floor area (see Limitation L11. in Table 17.101C.01 for all of the complementary activities that count as retail floor area); ii. Internal pedestrian stairs, corridors, and circulation; iii. Ground-floor public plaza/open space located on-site or adjacent off-site. b. Utilization of existing buildings towards new retail floor area can count toward the retail square footage. In the case of a CEQA Historic Resource: i. New retail square footage in a CEQA Historic Resource can count double towards the retail square footage required to obtain a residential bonus; or ii. If a CEQA Historic Resource is maintained and not used for retail, the

--- Chunk 708 ---
area of its footprint can be deducted from the overall square footage of the Retail Priority Site in determining the square footage of retail required. c. Square footage of the following do not count towards the retail square footage minimum: i. Loading dock; ii. Parking; iii. Driveways, ramps, and circulation for cars and trucks. 3. If a project is phased, the minimum retail portion must be built first or concurrently with any residential portion. Any additional residential bonus units that are dependent on additional retail square footage may also only be built after the retail project or concurrently. If determined by the Director of City Planning, an applicant may be required to submit a financial guarantee, in a form and manner acceptable to the City, that the retail space will be built as part of the conditions of approval of the project. 4. An applicant that provides a retail project that equals at least sixty percent (60%) of the square footage of the Retail Priority Site may transfer the development rights of residential bonus units and height from one retail priority site to a different lot within the same retail priority site or to a lot within a different retail

--- Chunk 709 ---
priority site upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). A CUP to transfer development rights of residential bonus units may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria contained in Section 17.134.050 and to each of the following additional criteria: a. The applicant has acquired development rights from the owner(s) of lots within a Retail Priority Site Zone, restricting the number of residential units which may be developed thereon so long as the facilities proposed by the applicant are in existence; b. The owners of all such lots shall prepare and execute an agreement, approved as to form and legality by the City Attorney and filed with the Alameda County Recorder, incorporating such restriction; c. The proposed location and site planning of any transferred residential bonus units will not make infeasible future construction of the minimum retail square footage required at that Retail Priority Site; --- Page 444 --- OAKLAND 444 d. Residential bonus units can only be transferred to a lot that cannot meet the minimum retail square footage required in that Retail Priority Site to build residential; e. The site receiving the transferred residential units must include retail area

--- Chunk 710 ---
on the ground floor pursuant to the requirements of the D-BV-1 Broadway Retail Priority Sites Zone; and f. Retail floor area that existed prior to the effective date of this Chapter (July 31, 2014) cannot count towards the retail square footage needed for transfer of development rights for residential bonus units to other Retail Priority Sites. 5. For a bonus of residential units, the State Density Bonus can be applied by providing affordable housing units (see California Government Code, Section 65915-65918, as implemented by Chapter 17.101 of the Oakland Planning Code) or an applicant can utilize the following residential bonus within a Retail Priority Zone. However, these bonuses cannot be combined. The affordable units can be built on site or on another site within any D-BV Zone. The residential bonus shall not be included when determining the number of target units that must be affordable to the relevant income group. If fifteen percent (15%) of the total Dwelling Units of a Residential Housing Development are affordable, an additional residential bonus of thirty-five percent (35%) will be granted when an applicant for a Residential Housing Development seeks, and agrees to construct, at least any one of the following categories (which are

--- Chunk 711 ---
defined in Section17.107.020 (K), the following definitions in Section 17.107.020 (A)(B)(J)(M) also apply, and all of the provisions of Sections 17.107.110 – 17.107.114 must be met): a. Lower Income Households; or b. Very Low Income Households; or c. A common interest development as defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, for persons and families of Moderate Income, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase. 6. In the Retail Priority Areas, an exception to the minimum retail square footage required to receive the bonus right to residential units may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria contained in Section 17.134.050, to any applicable use permit criteria set forth in Table 17.101C.01, Note L2, and to each of the following additional criteria: a. The applicant submits an architectural study, prepared by a qualified architectural firm, that demonstrates at least one or more alternatives would be physically infeasible due to operational and/or site constraints if it were to meet the minimum retail square footage specified; b. Strict compliance with the minimum retail square footage would preclude an effective design solution improving livability, operational efficiency, or appearance;

--- Chunk 712 ---
and c. The project will remain consistent with the Broadway Valdez District Specific Plan goals and policies related to retail development as well as its Design Guidelines. D. Retail Priority Sites: Height, Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Residential Bonus, and Open Space. Table 17.101C.06 below prescribes height, FAR, residential bonus, and open space, standards associated with the minimum retail area required in the Retail Priority Sites described in Table 17.101C.05 above.

initial decision rather than acting on it himself or herself. 2. Procedure for Consideration of Design Review: Applications for design review shall be considered by the Director of City Planning or the Planning Commission according to the following procedures: a. Decisions by the Planning Commission shall be made at a public hearing. At his or her discretion, the Director of City Planning may hold an administrative hearing for projects under his or her review. b.

That the proposal will help achieve or maintain a group of facilities which are well related to one another and which, when taken together, will result in a well-composed design, with consideration given to site, landscape, bulk, height, arrangement, texture, materials, colors, and appurtenances; the relation of these factors to other facilities in the vicinity; and the relation of the proposal to the total setting as seen from key points in the surrounding area. Only elements of design which have some significant relationship to outside appearance shall be considered; and b. That the proposed design will be of a quality and character which harmonizes with, and serves to protect the value of, private and public investments in the area; and c. That the

--- Chunk 742 ---
proposed design conforms in all significant respects with the Oakland General Plan and with any applicable district plan or development control map which has been adopted by the City Council; and d. That any proposed retaining wall is consistent with the overall building and site design and respects the natural landscape and topography of the site and surrounding areas, and that the retaining wall is responsive to human scale, avoiding large, blank, uninterrupted or un-designed vertical surfaces. F. Adherence to Approved Plans. A design review approval shall be subject to the plans and other conditions upon the basis of which it was granted and shall terminate in accordance with Section 17.136.100. G. Revocation/Enforcement. In the event of a violation of any of the provisions of the zoning regulations, or in the event of a failure to comply with any prescribed condition of approval, --- Page 460 --- OAKLAND 460 or if the activity causes a public nuisance, the City may, after holding a public hearing, revoke any design review approval or other approval or take other enforcement actions in accordance with the procedures in Chapter 17.152.

See Table 17.101E.04 for reduced setbacks for smaller lots, and Sections 17.106.010 and 17.106.020 for exceptions to lot area, lot width mean, and street frontage regulations. 2. In the D-CE-3 Zone, minimum yards shall be consistent with the adopted "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary". In the D-CE-4 Zone, the minimum front setback shall be reduced to 0 feet along all lot lines designated as Public Frontages on the Zoning Map (see Section 17.101E.060 for a description of this frontage type). See also Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks, and see the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Sections 3.3 and 4.1. 3. In the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones, see Section 17.108.080 for the required interior side and rear yard setbacks on a lot containing two (2) or more dwelling units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units, and opposite a legally required living room window. Wherever a rear lot line abuts an alley, one-half (½) of the right-of-way width of the alley may be counted toward the required minimum rear setback; provided however, that the

--- Chunk 780 ---
portion of the minimum rear setback actually on the lot itself shall not be so reduced to less than five (5) feet. Also, wherever a rear lot line abuts another lot where the existing primary facility is nonresidential, the required minimum rear setback shall be reduced to five (5) feet. See Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks. 4. Buildings shall have a thirty (30) foot maximum height at the required setback line associated with any rear lot line that directly abuts a lot with a residential building. This maximum height shall increase one (1) foot for every foot away from the applicable setback line if the residential building on the abutting lot has a height of thirty (30) feet or less. If the residential building on the abutting lot has a height of greater than thirty (30) feet, the maximum height shall increase four (4) feet for every foot away from the applicable setback line. An increase in allowable height shall not exceed the maximum height allowed in the zone. See Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits and Section 17.108.020 for increased height limits in certain situations. 5. See the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Sections

--- Chunk 781 ---
3 and 4, to ensure that proposed buildings in the D-CE-3 Zone are scaled to a context that will be compatible with adjacent uses. 6. In the D-CE-3 Zone, the maximum heights may be exceeded in the following situations: Structures that are either: 1) on lots adjacent to, or directly across the street from a freeway right- of-way or Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) right-of-way that contains above-ground tracks; or 2) located within the closest one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of the lot from the freeway or BART right-of-way are eligible for a ninety-five (95) foot height limit. This additional height is permitted only upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit (see Chapter 17.134) and approval pursuant to the Design Review procedure (see Chapter 17.136). See also the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Sections 3 and 4. 7. In the D-CE-3 Zone, the outdoor storage of materials shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height on a lot. Further, outdoor storage may not be higher than eight (8) feet if both: (1) the storage is within fifteen (15) feet from any property line of a lot containing Residential Activities and (2) the storage faces any windows of a

--- Chunk 782 ---
Residential Facility. Outdoor storage may also not be higher than eight (8) feet if it is within fifteen (15) feet from the front property line. The height of all outdoor storage shall also be restricted according to the Oakland Fire Code regulations. Sites with outdoor storage shall be screened in conformance to the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary". In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, the height of outdoor materials stored within the required side or rear setback shall be no higher than eight (8) feet. However, outdoor materials may be stored up to ten (10) feet if they are no higher than a solid masonry wall that is located between the materials and the property line associated with the required setback in which the --- Page 483 --- OAKLAND 483 materials are located. In this case, buffer planting must be installed between the storage area and the masonry wall. The aisle width and material composition of all stored material, and the ultimate height of all outdoor materials stored beyond the required setback shall be according to the Fire Code regulations. 8. In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, this regulation applies to all property lines which directly abut a Residential

--- Chunk 783 ---
or Open Space Zone, except those fronting a public street. Buffering requirements also apply to: a) new development; or expansion of an industrial or commercial building by more than twenty percent (20%) of total floor area, or b) addition or expansion of an existing building so that the lot coverage exceeds thirty-five percent (35%), whichever is greatest. The planting requirement may be reduced but not eliminated if appropriate and approved by the Planning Director. The twelve (12) foot maximum fence height may only be achieved with additional screening. The fence or wall design shall be approved by the Planning Director. See also "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Section 3.8 and 4.1. 9. In the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones, see Chapter 17.107 and Section 17.106.060 for affordable and senior housing incentives. See Section 17.103.080 and Chapter 17.88 for regulations regarding permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. Also applicable are the provisions of Section 17.102.270 with respect to additional kitchens for a primary dwelling unit, and the provisions of Section 17.102.300 with respect to dwelling units with five (5) or more bedrooms. In the D-CE-3 Zone, new construction on a vacant lot that is greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet shall only

--- Chunk 784 ---
result in a total of one (1) unit on the lot upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit (see Chapter 17.134 for the Conditional Use Permit process). This requirement does not apply to the expansion of the floor area or other alteration of an existing One-Family Dwelling. 10. As specified in Section 17.106.030, the total lot area shall be used as the basis for computing both the maximum nonresidential FAR and the maximum residential density for mixed use projects. 11. In the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones, usable open space is not required for Work/Live, and is only required on lots with two (2) or more Residential or Live/Work units, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. Each one (1) square foot of private usable open space equals two (2) square feet towards the total usable open space requirement. All usable open space shall meet the standards contained in Chapter 17.126, except that group usable open space may be located anywhere on the lot, provided the Frontage Type design guidelines are followed (see Section 4.1 of the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary"). 12. In the D-CE-5 Zone, parking for new development shall be located at the rear of the site

--- Chunk 785 ---
or at the side of the building except for drop-off areas, which may be at the entry, except where access to existing loading docks and/or rail lines is required. New truck loading docks shall not be located closer than fifty (50) feet from property line as measured from the subject dock to any property boundary if located within three hundred (300) feet of a Residential Zone, unless such a distance requirement will impede direct access to a rail line. Truck docks shall be located such that trucks do not encroach into the public right-of-way. All existing loading docks are not subject to this requirement. 13. Any new principal residential building or addition over one thousand (1,000) square feet requires submittal and approval of a landscaping and buffering plan for the entire site, excluding any permitted Accessory Dwelling Units. The landscaping and buffering plan shall contain the following: --- Page 484 --- OAKLAND 484 a. Landscaping and buffering that is consistent with the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary"; b. An automatic system of irrigation for all landscaping shown in the plan; c. A minimum of one (1) 15-gallon tree, or substantially equivalent landscaping as approved by the Director of City

--- Chunk 786 ---
Planning, for every twenty-five (25) feet of street frontage or portion thereof. On streets with sidewalks where the distance from the face of the curb to the outer edge of the sidewalk is at least six and one-half (6½) feet, the trees shall be street trees to the satisfaction of the City's Tree Division. d. At least one (1) 15-gallon tree in the parking lot for every six (6) parking spaces for projects that involve new or existing parking lots of three thousand (3,000) square feet or greater. e. A minimum of five (5) feet of landscaping shall be required adjacent to the front and street side property lines for parking lots of three thousand (3,000) square feet or greater. Where parking stalls face into this required buffer area, the width of the required landscaping shall be increased by two (2) feet unless wheel stops are installed. 14. In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, the following landscape requirements apply: a. Submittal and approval of a landscape plan for the entire site and street frontage is required for the establishment of a new Nonresidential Facility and for additions to Nonresidential Facilities of over one thousand (1,000) square feet (see Section 17.124.025).

--- Chunk 787 ---
A minimum of five percent (5%) of the lot area shall be landscaped. Landscaping and buffering must be consistent with guidelines in the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Section 3.8. b. Required parking lot landscaping: For all lots associated with construction of more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of new floor area, a minimum of ten percent (10%) of parking lot area shall be landscaped accompanied by an irrigation system that is permanent, below grade and activated by automatic timing controls; permeable surfacing in lieu of irrigated landscaping may be provided if approved through design review procedure in Chapter 17.136. Shade trees shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) tree for every ten (10) spaces throughout the parking lot. Parking lots located adjacent to a public right-of-way shall include screening consistent with the landscaping and buffering guidelines in the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary". 15. For all Nonresidential projects over one thousand (1,000) square feet, street trees are required. In addition to the general landscaping requirements set forth above, a minimum of one (1) 15-gallon tree, or substantially equivalent landscaping consistent with City policy and as approved by the Director of City Planning, shall be

--- Chunk 788 ---
provided for every twenty (20) feet of street frontage or portion thereof and, if a curbside planting strip exists, for every twenty-five (25) feet of street frontage. On streets with sidewalks where the distance from the face of the curb to the outer edge of the sidewalk is at least six and one-half (6½) feet, the trees to be provided shall include street trees to the satisfaction of the Tree Division. 16. In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, the site and driveway access requirement applies to new development; or expansion of industrial or commercial buildings by more than twenty percent (20%) floor area; or b) addition or expansion of an existing building so that the building to land ratio exceeds thirty-five percent (35%), whichever is greater; and all new driveway projects. This --- Page 485 --- OAKLAND 485 requirement may be waived administratively if such distance requirement will impede direct access to a rail line. Also applicable are the provisions of Chapter 17.116. 17. In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, a driveway shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet in width without obtaining approval from the Engineering Department of Building Services through the Driveway Appeal Process. Also applicable are the provisions

--- Chunk 789 ---
of Chapter 17.116. 18. In the D-CE-5 and D-CE-6 Zones, a clearly defined and lighted walkway, at least four (4) feet wide, shall be provided between the main building entry and a public sidewalk for all new development. On-site walkways shall be separated from on-site automobile circulation and parking areas by landscaping, a change in paving material, or a change in elevation. See the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Section 3.4, 3.7 and 5. 19. See Section 17.103.080 for additional parking regulations that apply to Accessory Dwelling Units. 20.

--- Chunk 790 ---
A. Applicability. The frontage types described below are only applicable to the Central Estuary Zones. B. Definitions. (See the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary", Section 4.1) The following definitions apply to this Chapter only: 1. Public Frontage - The Public Frontage type accommodates very public uses, where interaction with the street and open spaces is desirable and welcomed, requiring little or --- Page 486 --- OAKLAND 486 no transition between the two. The Public Frontage is fully open to the street with large amounts of glazing. Windows may go from ground floor to ceiling and may be operable to promote a close indoor/outdoor relationship. Entries and windows are frequent, creating an inviting visual and physical connection with activity along the street. This frontage type is often associated with shopfronts and dining establishments. Live/Work facilities where retail shopfronts are a component may also be associated with this frontage type. 2. Semi-Public Frontage - The Semi-Public Frontage is defined by a moderate amount of permeability. This frontage type requires some transition from the public realm, which may be in the form of a landscaped setback, vertical separation or less transparency. This frontage type maintains a fair amount of glazing, though in

--- Chunk 791 ---
a configuration that offers more privacy to interior uses that require some separation from the street, such as higher window sills, than the Public Frontage type. Building access may be less frequent than the Public Frontage or defined by a singular entry lobby and though generally still open and welcoming, may be somewhat more restricted than the Public Frontage. Entries may be characterized by porches, stoops, terraces, or lobbies. It is most often associated with employment uses, though it is flexible enough to accommodate Work/Live, warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, as it allows ample amounts of natural light balanced with a greater sense of privacy and buffer from street activity. 3. Private Frontage - This frontage requires the most privacy and buffering between interior uses and adjacent streets, the waterfront, public plazas, and open spaces. A transition zone is necessary to provide a clear distinction between public and private space. This frontage type is closely associated with residential and Live/Work facilities. 4. Service Frontage - Service Frontages are defined by large expanses of blank walls with few doors and windows, mostly broken by garage doors and truck bays. Building entries are minimal with few pedestrian amenities and are not elaborately detailed.

--- Chunk 792 ---
This frontage is associated with warehousing, distribution, and sometimes manufacturing businesses. This frontage is also utilized by large-format, warehouse style retailers. This frontage is commonly found in the Central Estuary area, but should be avoided or used sparingly along public spaces. C. Table 17.101E.05 below prescribes development standards specific to frontage types allowed. The number designations in the "Additional Regulations" column refer to the regulations listed at the end of the Table. Intent, guidance and application of building Frontage Types can be found in the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary."

Glazed garage doors and entry doors, transom windows and display windows may be counted toward minimum glazed area. 3. Not required to be interrupted by windows and doors, but shall incorporate other blank wall elements as described in the Facade Articulation (Section 4.7) and Building Frontage Types (Section 4.1) in the "Design Guidelines for the Central Estuary". (Ord. No. 13168, § 5(Exh. A), 6-18-2013) 17.101E.070 Special regulations for D-CE Work/Live Units. A. Applicability. 1. Work/Live space shall be considered Commercially/ Industrially Oriented Joint Living and Working Quarters under the Building Code. Any building permit plans for the construction or establishment of Work/Live units shall: (1) clearly state that the proposal includes Commercially/Industrially Oriented Joint Living and Working Quarters, and (2) label the units intended to be these units as Commercially/ Industrially Oriented Joint Living and Working Quarters. This requirement is to assure the City applies building codes that allow Industrial Activities in Work/Live units in the Industrial Zones. 2. Work/Live units are Nonresidential Facilities and counted towards the nonresidential floor area ratio, not the residential density. 3. D-CE-3 and

--- Chunk 794 ---
D-CE-4 Zones. A Work/Live unit in the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones must meet all applicable regulations contained in this Section. The D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones regulations in this Section supersede regulations contained in Section 17.102.190 relating to the conversion of buildings originally designed for Commercial or Industrial Activities into joint living and working quarters. 4. D-CE-5 Zone. A Work/Live unit in the D-CE-5 Zone must meet all applicable regulations contained in this Section. The D-CE-5 Zones regulations in this Section supersede regulations contained in Section 17.102.190 relating to the conversion of buildings originally designed for Commercial or Industrial Activities into joint living and working quarters for Work/Live units. 5. D-CE-1, D-CE-2, and D-CE-6 Zones. Work/Live units are not allowed in the D-CE-1, D- CE-2, or D-CE-6 Zones. B. Definition. The following definitions apply to this Chapter only: --- Page 488 --- OAKLAND 488 1. For purposes of Work/Live conversion, an "existing building" must be at least ten (10) years old and originally designed for industrial or commercial occupancy. 2. "Residential floor area" shall be considered areas containing bedrooms, sleeping areas, kitchen areas and bathrooms and hallways serving such areas. 3. "Nonresidential floor area" shall include floor areas designated for working.

--- Chunk 795 ---
C. Design review requirement. Establishment of a Work/Live unit shall conform to the design review criteria set forth in the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136, and if Regular Design Review is applicable, to all of the following additional criteria: 1. That the exterior of a new building containing primarily Work/Live units in the Industrial Zones has a commercial or industrial appearance. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the use of nonresidential building styles or other techniques; 2. That units on the ground floor level of a building have a business presence on the street. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, providing roll-up doors at the street or storefront style windows that allow interior space to be visible from the street, a business door that is oriented towards the street, a sign or other means that identifies the business on the door and elsewhere, a prominent ground floor height, or other techniques; 3. That the layout of nonresidential floor areas within a unit provides a functional and bona fide open area for working activities; 4. That the floor and site plan for the project include an adequate provision for the delivery of items required for a

--- Chunk 796 ---
variety of businesses. This may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: a. Service elevators designed to carry and move oversized items; b. Stairwells wide and/or straight enough to deliver large items; c. Loading areas located near stairs and/or elevators; d. Wide corridors for the movement of oversized items; and e. That the floor and site plan for the project provide units that are easily identified as businesses and conveniently accessible by clients, employees and other business visitors. D. Table 17.101E.06 below prescribes special regulations for D-CE Work/Live Units. The number designations in the "Additional Regulations" column refer to the regulations listed at the end of the Table. "P" designates permitted activities in the corresponding zone. "C" designates activities that are permitted only upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) in the corresponding zone (see Chapter 17.134 for the CUP procedure).

See Section 17.108.040 for the minimum front yard setback when fifty percent (50%) or more of the frontage on the same block and side of the street is in a Residential Zone. 3. The following notes apply to the maximum yard requirements: a. The requirements only apply to the construction of new principal buildings and to no more than two property lines. One of these property lines shall abut the principal street. b. The requirements do not apply to lots containing Recreational Assembly, Community Education, Utility and Vehicular, or Extensive Impact Civic Activities or Automobile and Other Light Vehicle Gas Station and Servicing Commercial Activities as principal activities. c. These maximum yards apply to seventy-five percent (75%) of the street frontage on the principal street and fifty percent (50%) on other streets, if any. All percentages, however,

--- Chunk 843 ---
may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) upon the granting of Regular Design Review (see Chapter 17.136 for the design review procedure). In addition to the criteria contained in 17.136.050, the proposal must also meet each of the following criteria: --- Page 520 --- OAKLAND 520 i. Any additional yard area abutting the principal street is designed to accommodate publicly accessible plazas, sidewalk cafes, or restaurants; ii. The proposal will not impair a generally continuous wall of building facades; iii. The proposal will not weaken the concentration and continuity of retail facilities at ground-level, and will not impair the retention or creation of an important shopping frontage; and iv. The proposal will not interfere with the movement of people along an important pedestrian street. d. The maximum yard requirements above the ground floor may be waived upon the granting of a conditional use permit (see Chapter 17.134 for the CUP procedure). In addition to the criteria contained in Section 17.134.050, the proposal must also meet each of the following criteria: i. It infeasible to both accommodate the use proposed for the space and meet the maximum yard requirement; ii. The proposal will not weaken the street definition provided by buildings

--- Chunk 844 ---
with reduced setbacks; and iii. The proposal will not interrupt a continuity of 2nd and 3rd story facades on the street that have minimal front yard setbacks. 4. This regulation is the average setback distance, measured from the mean high tide line, along the total length of channel frontage involved in a project, with a minimum setback at any point of forty (40) feet. 5. This percentage of transparency is only required for principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and only applies to the facade facing the principal street. On all other street facing facades, the requirement is one-half (½) the standard for the facade facing the principal street. The area of required transparency is between two (2) feet and nine (9) feet in height of the ground floor and must be comprised of clear, non-reflective windows that allow views out of indoor activity space or lobbies. Glass block does not qualify as a transparent window. Exceptions to this regulation may be allowed by the Planning Director for unique facilities such as convention centers, gymnasiums, parks, gas stations, theaters and other similar facilities. 6. This height is required for new principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities,

--- Chunk 845 ---
and is measured from the sidewalk grade to the second story floor. 7. This regulation only applies to new construction of ground floor storefronts as part of a mixed use development project. Also see Lake Merritt Station Area Plan Design Guidelines for further guidance. 8. This regulation only applies to ground floor living space located within fifteen (15) feet of a street frontage. 9. Vehicular Residential Facilities shall be located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the street or be located behind a building. See Section 17.103.085 for additional setback and separation requirements for Vehicular Residential Facilities. B. Height, Bulk, and Intensity Area Specific Standards.

In Height/Bulk/Intensity Areas LM-95 and LM-175, a limited number of buildings, as prescribed above in Table 17.101G.04, may be allowed to utilize the same height/bulk/intensity standards that typically apply to either Height/Bulk/Intensity Area LM-175 or LM-275 upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134 and to the following additional use permit criteria: a. The proposal is consistent with the intent and desired land use character identified in the Lake Merritt Station Area Plan and its associated policies; b. The proposal will promote implementation of the Lake Merritt Station Area Plan; and c. The proposal is consistent with the desired visual character described in the Lake Merritt Station Area Plan and Lake Merritt Station Area Design Guidelines, with consideration given to the existing character of the site and surrounding area. The following application process for a height area exception shall be followed: i. Applications for any of the limited number of allowed height area exceptions prescribed in Table 17.101G.04 shall be reviewed on a first come, first

--- Chunk 849 ---
served basis. ii. A project shall secure a position as one of the specified height area exceptions following final Conditional Use Permit approval. Such Conditional Use Permits shall include a condition of approval that establishes a schedule for: submittal of a building permit application, timely response to plan check comments, payment of building permit fees such that a building permit can be issued, and commencement of construction. The process for allowing extension of the timeline requirements, if any, shall be specified in the condition. iii. Failure of a permittee to strictly comply with the schedule established by the Conditional Use Permit shall be grounds for revocation of the Conditional Use Permit pursuant to Chapter 17.134. Notwithstanding the provisions above, BART owned properties subject to Assembly Bill (AB) 2923 (2018) shall be permitted a building height of up to twelve (12) stories for all activities. 3. This minimum height excludes the height of the allowed projections into the height limit contained in Section 17.108.030. 4. For mixed use projects in the D-LM Zones, the allowable intensity of development shall be measured according to both the maximum nonresidential Floor Area Ratio (FAR) allowed by the zone and the maximum residential density allowed

--- Chunk 850 ---
by the zone. The total lot area shall be used --- Page 524 --- OAKLAND 524 as a basis for computing both the maximum nonresidential FAR and the maximum residential density. 5. The maximum tower elevation length, diagonal length, and average per story lot coverage above the building base may be increased by up to thirty percent (30%) upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134 and to the following additional use permit criteria: a. The proposal will result in a signature building within the neighborhood, City, or region based on qualities, including but not limited to, exterior visual quality, craftsmanship, detailing, and high quality and durable materials. 17.101G.060 Usable open space standards.

A. Title and Intent. The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the D-OK Oak Knoll District Zones Regulations. The intent of the Oak Knoll District (D-OK) Zones is to implement the Oak Knoll District Planned Unit Development (OKPUD) permit. The OKPUD intends to establish and maintain a pedestrian-oriented neighborhood that contains a mix of housing types, community amenities, a retail area, passive and active recreational opportunities, and open spaces. These regulations shall apply to the six (6) zoning districts (the D-OK zones) in the OKPUD area. B. Description of Zones. This Chapter establishes land use regulations for the following six zones: 1. D-OK-1 Oak Knoll District Residential Zone - 1. The D-OK-1 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas suitable for low-density single-family home development that responds to the site’s topography and includes appropriate landscaping. 2. D-OK-2 Oak Knoll District Residential Zone - 2. The D-OK-2 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas suitable

--- Chunk 890 ---
for medium-low density single-family homes. 3. D-OK-3 Oak Knoll District Residential Zone - 3. The D-OK-3 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas suitable for medium-density residential units, such as townhomes. 4. D-OK-4 Oak Knoll District Commercial Zone - 4. The D-OK-4 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas that provide neighborhood-serving retail, such as supermarkets, banks, cafes, and dry-cleaners. Ground floor commercial uses and upper story office uses are encouraged in this zone. 5. D-OK-5 Oak Knoll District Amenity Community Commercial Zone - 5. The D-OK-5 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance areas for community activities and --- Page 550 --- OAKLAND 550 commercial uses that provide a community amenity. Although this area is intended primarily to serve the community, spaces may be rented for non-community functions, including weddings and other organized events. 6. D-OK-6 Oak Knoll District Active Open Space Zone – 6. The D-OK-6 Zone is intended to create, maintain and enhance open space areas that provide opportunities for informal active recreation and park use. The programming of each individual open space will respond to its location and the needs of surrounding residents. This zone is appropriate for lawn and landscaped

--- Chunk 891 ---
areas, tot lots, and street furniture, such as benches, tables, and ornamental fixtures. 7. D-OK-7 Oak Knoll District Passive Open Space Zone - 7. The D-OK-7 Zone is intended to create, maintain, and enhance open space areas that preserve natural features of the OKPUD area and provide opportunities for passive recreation and maintenance of visual buffers. The programing of each individual open space will respond to its location, natural resources, and topography. This zone is appropriate for management of vegetation and water features, hiking and walking trails, and enhancement of wildlife. 17.101J.020 – Required Design Review Process, Including Preliminary and Final Development Plan Approval and Oak Knoll Design Guidelines. A. All development within the Oak Knoll District is subject to an approved Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit pursuant to Chapters 17.140 and 17.142. B. Development within the District shall be consistent with the Oak Knoll Preliminary Development Plan (as it may be amended), in particular with the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines, which were adopted as part of the Preliminary Development Plan. Conformance to the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines is required for any change to the exterior of a building that requires a building permit in the Oak Knoll District. C.

--- Chunk 892 ---
In addition, as applicable, development is subject to the following design review requirements: 1. Original development of more than two lots at the same time shall require approval of, and be consistent with, a Final Development Plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.140. For development requiring a Final Development Plan, a determination of consistency with the Final Development Plan shall take the place of, and be deemed equivalent to, the design review procedures in Chapter 17.136. 2. Original development of two or fewer lots at the same time shall be subject to the design review procedures set forth in under 17.136. 3. Subsequent approvals to existing development shall be subject to design review under Chapter 17.136, except where such projects are exempt from design review pursuant to Section 17.136.025. Where there is a conflict between the design review criteria contained in Section 17.136.070 and the design objectives contained in the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines, the design objectives in the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines shall prevail. 4. Telecommunications facilities shall be subject to design review in accordance with Chapter 17.128 unless they have already been approved pursuant to a Final Development Plan. 5. Signs other than those

--- Chunk 893 ---
covered by a Final Development Plan shall be subject to design review in accordance with Chapter 17.104. --- Page 551 --- OAKLAND 551 17.101J.030 – Permitted and conditionally permitted activities.

Also in the D-OK-5 Zone, for any building other than Club Knoll or a replica of Club Knoll, the height limit is the same as in the D-OK-4 Zone. 13. The per unit Group Open Space requirement can be replaced by 70 square feet of dedicated Private Open Space per unit. All usable Group Open Space shall meet the requirements in Sections 17.126.030.A through 17.126.030.E. Usable Private Open Space shall meet the following requirements: a. Usability. A surface shall be provided which prevents dust and allows convenient use for outdoor activities. Such surface shall be any practicable combination of lawn, garden, flagstone, wood planking, concrete, asphalt, or other serviceable, dust-free surfacing. Slope shall not exceed ten percent (10%). Off-street parking and loading areas, driveways, and service areas shall not be counted as usable open space. Adequate safety railings or other protective devices shall be erected wherever necessary for space on a roof or balcony, but shall not be more than the minimum height required by the Oakland Building Code. b. Location. The

--- Chunk 910 ---
space may be located anywhere on the lot. Above-ground-level space may be counted even though it projects beyond a street line. All spaces shall be adjacent to, and not more than four (4) feet above or below the floor level of, the living unit served. c. Size and Shape. An area of contiguous ground-level space shall be of such size and shape that a rectangle inscribed within it shall have no dimension less than ten (10) feet. An area of above-ground-level space shall be of such size and shape that a rectangle inscribed within it shall have no dimension less than five (5) feet. When space is located on a roof, the area occupied by vents or other structures which do not enhance usability of the space shall not be counted toward the above dimension. d. Accessibility. The space shall be accessible to only one living unit by a doorway to a habitable room or hallway. e. Openness. There shall be no obstructions over ground-level space except for devices to enhance its usability and except that not more than fifty percent (50%) of the space may be covered by a private balcony projecting from a higher story. Above-ground-level space shall

--- Chunk 911 ---
have at least one exterior side open and unobstructed, except for incidental railings or balustrades, for eight (8) feet above its floor level. Enclosures and landscaping for both usable Group and Private Open Spaces must be consistent with the requirements in the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines. 14. In the D-OK District Residential Zones, Section 2.6 of the Oak Knoll Design Guidelines applies. Parking and loading requirements in the D-OK-4 Zone are the same as in the CN-4 Zone, subject to the exceptions stated in Note 15 below. 15.

L9. With the exception of public utility facilities, no new buildings or additions to existing buildings (including accessory structures) shall be constructed unless they are either: 1) part of a project that includes the construction of a principal building that is at least one hundred (100) feet in height, or 2) on a site that contains an existing principal building that is at least one hundred (100) feet in height. This minimum height is measured to the floor of the top story. L10. With the exception of seasonal sales and special events, an Open Nonresidential Facility accommodating a Group Assembly Commercial Activity is only permitted upon the granting of Conditional Use Permit (see Chapter 17.134 for the CUP procedure). 17.101K.070 – Special Regulations for D-DT Work/Live Nonresidential Facilities. A. Definition of a D-DT Work/Live Unit. D-DT Work/Live Units are units contained within

--- Chunk 948 ---
D-DT Work/Live Nonresidential Facilities that are designed to contain working space with accessory living space, are used for living and working, and meet the requirements of this Section. B. A D-DT Work/Live Nonresidential Facility must meet all applicable regulations contained in this Section. Section 17.102.190 relating to the conversion of buildings originally designed for Commercial or Industrial Activities into Joint Living and Working Quarters (JLWQs) does not apply to the D-DT Zones. C. D-DT Work/Live Units are Nonresidential Facilities and counted towards the nonresidential Floor Area Ratio, not the residential density. D. All D-DT Work/Live Units shall be designed under the Building Code to accommodate customers and employees. In the D-DT-AG and D-DT-PM Zones, D-DT Work/Live Units shall be designed under the Building Code to allow Manufacturing Activities. --- Page 586 --- OAKLAND 586 E. At least two-thirds of each unit shall be designated for working activities. Working and living activities shall be designated according to the following requirements: 1. In unpartitioned kitchens or work areas that include kitchen fixtures and appliances, the following areas are considered living space: the counters, cabinets, eating space, sink and appliances in the area that will function as a kitchen and the floor area

--- Chunk 949 ---
that is four (4) feet in front these items. 2. If there is only one bathroom, half the bathroom shall be counted as living space and half shall be counted as workspace. Otherwise, bathrooms are counted as living space if their access is through living space. For instance, a bathroom in a loft is considered living space if the loft is a sleeping area. If the bathroom is accessed directly from the workspace, the bathroom shall be counted as workspace. If accessed directly from both, half the bathroom is considered living space and the other half commercial. 3. Interior hallways and closets shall be counted as part of the space to which they are adjacent. 4. Living and working spaces shall be within the same Work/Live Unit and be directly connected. 5. To accommodate flexible work activities, working areas shall be open and with as few interior walls as possible. “Offices” enclosed by four walls are considered living space because they are indistinguishable from bedrooms and cannot be used flexibly for different working activities. 6. All ground-floor units adjacent to the front façade shall have a street entrance directly into the working area. For these units, the working area shall

--- Chunk 950 ---
be adjacent to the street right-of-way. F. Regular Design Review required. Establishment of a D-DT Work/Live Unit are only permitted upon determination that the proposal conforms to the Regular Design Review criteria set forth in the Design Review Procedure in Chapter 17.136 and to each of the following additional criteria: 1. Units on the ground-floor level of a building have a business presence on the street, including signage. For units in Commercial Zones, this includes a storefront-style façade as described in 17.101K.130(d). For units in Industrial Zones, this includes extra wide entrances and, if feasible, roll-up doors. For units in Residential Zones, this includes a business door that is oriented towards the street. 2. The layout of nonresidential floor areas within a Work/Live Unit provides a functional open area for working activities. 3. The floor and site plan for the project includes an adequate provision for the delivery of items required for a variety of businesses, including artist’s work. This may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: a. Service elevators designed to carry and move oversized items; b. Extra-large slop sinks; c. Doors, corridors, and stairwells wide and/or straight enough to deliver large items; and d. Loading

--- Chunk 951 ---
areas located near stairs and/or elevators; G. Activity, auto parking, bicycle parking, loading, open space, and unit size standards. Table 17.101K.03 below prescribes special regulations for D-DT Work/Live Units in applicable D-DT zones. Table 17.101K.03 Special Regulations for D-DT Work/Live Units Standard Requirement Notes Activities allowed in a Work/Live Unit Same permitted and conditionally permitted activities as described in Section 17.101K.050 for the applicable primary zone. For Residential Zones, activities permitted as Home Occupations are also permitted. Chapter 17.112 contains the Home Occupation regulations. --- Page 587 --- OAKLAND 587 Standard Requirement Notes Minimum size of a Work/Live Unit 800 square feet Required auto parking No auto parking spaces required Required bicycle parking One long-term space for each unit; minimum requirement is four long-term spaces. Five short-term spaces for each 20 units; minimum requirement is four short-term spaces. 1 Required usable open space For new D-DT Work/Live Units that are completely or partially outside the envelope of an existing building, the usable open space requirements for regular dwelling units are applied (see Section 17.101K.150 for these open space requirements). No additional usable open space is required for D-DT Work/Live Units that are completely within the envelope of an existing building.

--- Chunk 952 ---
For these conversions, maintaining existing usable open space to at least the minimum standards for regular dwelling units is required. Required loading 1, 2 Less than 50,000 sf. No berth 50,000—199,999 sf. One berth 200,000 sf. or more Two berths Notes: 1. See Chapter 17.117 for bicycle parking standards. 2. Loading requirements apply to new construction only. For conversion of existing buildings, maintaining existing loading to at least three minimum number of berths is required. Also, see Chapter 17.116 for loading standards.

A. This section describes how to determine the principal street abutting a lot. B. The number of principal and secondary streets shall be determined in

--- Chunk 953 ---
the following manner: 1. For lots with one abutting street, the abutting street is the principal street; 2. For lots with two frontages, one (1) abutting street shall be the principal street and the other the secondary street; 3. For lots with three (3) or four (4) frontages, two (2) streets shall be principal streets and the remaining shall be secondary street(s); 4. For lots with five (5) or more frontages, three (3) streets shall be principal streets and the remaining shall be secondary street(s). C. The street(s) abutting a site with the highest priority as described in Subsection (D) shall be designated as the principal street(s). When streets have the same priority, the Planning Director or their designee shall determine the principal street(s). In this case, streets intended to have a high volume of pedestrian traffic and/or ground-floor commercial activity and streets with the most intact pattern of pedestrian entrances shall be identified as the principal street(s). D. In order of priority, the following shall be principal streets when they abut a development site: 1. Broadway, Telegraph Avenue, and San Pablo Avenue; 2. Streets in the D-DT-P Zone; 3. Thomas Berkley Way, 20th Street, and Oak Street; 4. Streets

--- Chunk 954 ---
in the Arts and Cultural Combining Zone; 5. Streets in the Green Loop Combining Zone; 6. Streets in the D-DT-C Zone; and 7.

See Sections 17.106.010 and 17.106.020 for exceptions to lot area, lot width mean and street frontage regulations. 2. No building shall be constructed within sixty (60) feet of the top of the bank of the Lake Merritt Channel. See Section 17.101K for other requirements for development adjacent to the Channel. 3. There is no front setback required, except as described in note 2; and there is a six (6) foot front setback required for new construction when the ground floor contains residential units adjacent to the principal street. --- Page 590 --- OAKLAND 590 4. In the D-DT-PM and D-DT-AG Zones, any upper-story addition shall be stepped back at least fifteen (15) feet from any street fronting facade. 5. See Section 17.108.130 for allowed projections into setbacks and Section 17.108.080 for the required interior side and rear setbacks on a lot containing two (2) or more living units and opposite a legally-required living room window. 6. The

--- Chunk 957 ---
following notes apply to the maximum yard requirements: a. In the D-DT-RX, D-DT-CX, and D-DT-CPW Zones, the maximum front and street side setback for the first story is five (5) feet for Commercial Facilities and ten (10) feet for Residential Facilities. b. The requirements only apply to the construction of new principal buildings and to no more than two property lines. One of these property lines shall abut the principal street (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal street). c. The requirements do not apply to new construction of facilities containing Civic Activities, Agricultural Activities, or Automobile and Other Light Vehicle Gas Station and Servicing Commercial Activities as principal activities. d. These maximum setbacks apply to seventy-five percent (75%) of the principal street facade and fifty percent (50%) on secondary streets, if any (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal and secondary streets). All percentages, however, may be reduced to fifty percent (50%) upon the granting of Regular Design Review (see Chapter 17.136 for the Design Review procedure). In addition to the criteria contained in Section 17.136.050, the proposal must also meet the following criterion: i. Any additional yard area abutting the principal street is designed

--- Chunk 958 ---
to accommodate publicly accessible plazas, sidewalk cafes, or restaurants, or to transition to the front setback of a neighboring Designated Historic Property or Potentially Designated Historic Property (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal street). 7. The rear setback in the D-DT-JLI zone is zero (0) feet for properties that do not abut parcels with Residential Facilities and ten (10) feet for properties that abut parcels with Residential Facilities. 8. This percentage of transparency is only required for principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities, and only applies to the principal street facade. On all secondary street facades, the requirement is one-half (½) the standard for the principal street façade (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal and secondary streets). The area of required transparency is between two (2) feet and nine (9) feet in height of the ground floor and must be comprised of clear, non-reflective windows that allow views out of indoor commercial space or lobbies. Glass block does not quality as a transparent window. Exceptions to this regulation may be allowed by the Director of the Planning Bureau, or his/her designee, for unique facilities such as convention centers, gymnasiums, parks, gas stations,

--- Chunk 959 ---
theaters and other similar facilities. 9. For ground floor Health Care and Special Health Care Civic Activities and Medical Services Commercial Activities this level of transparency can be reduced using fogged or otherwise opaque windows. However, windows adjacent to reception, lobby, and waiting areas shall remain transparent. 10. This height is required for new principal buildings that include ground floor Nonresidential Facilities and is measured from the sidewalk grade to the second story floor. 17.101K.100 – Base Height and Intensity Standards Base Height and Intensity Standards. Table 17.101K.05 below prescribes height and intensity standards in the D-DT Zones for projects not participating in the Zoning Incentive Program (ZIP), which --- Page 591 --- OAKLAND 591 is described in Section 17.101K.110. The numbers in the right-hand column refer to the additional regulations listed at the end of the Table. "N/A" designates the regulation is not applicable to the specified Height and Intensity Area. The base height and intensity standards may be exceeded through the ZIP and/or through State Density Bonus Law (CA Gov’t Code Section 65915 et seq.). Refer to Section 17.101K.110 for the D- DT Zoning ZIP Height and Intensity Regulations, which specify the maximum amount of development if a

For mixed use projects in the D-DT Zones, the allowable intensity of development shall be measured according to both the maximum nonresidential Floor Area Ratio (FAR) allowed by the zone and the maximum residential density allowed by the zone. The total lot area shall be used as a basis for computing both the maximum nonresidential FAR and the maximum residential density. 3. See Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits and Section 17.108.020 for increased height limits for civic buildings. 4. In the D-DT-CPW Zone, no new additions, accessory structures, or principal buildings shall be constructed unless they are either:

--- Chunk 965 ---
1) part of a project that includes the construction of a principal building that is at least one hundred (100) feet in height, or 2) on a site that contains an existing principal building that is at least one hundred (100) feet in height to the floor of the top story. This minimum height excludes the height of the allowed projections into the height limit contained in Section 17.108.030, Sign Facilities, and Telecommunications Facilities. Also, see Section 17.101K.040, which requires the granting of a Planned Unit Development Permit for all new construction and additions. 5. This minimum height excludes the height of the allowed projections into the height limit contained in Section 17.108.030, Sign Facilities, and Telecommunications Facilities. 6. The minimum height limit of properties within the Employment Priority Combining Zone is one hundred seventy five (175) feet. 7. Buildings constructed to accommodate Essential Service, Utility and Vehicular, or Extensive Impact Civic Activities as principal activities are exempted from the height minimum regulation. The allowed projections into the height limits contained in Section 17.108.030 are not counted towards the height minimum. 8. The minimum height of the base can be reduced to allow transition to a lower-scale neighboring Potentially Designated

height of the allowed projections into the height limit contained in Section 17.108.030, Sign Facilities, and Telecommunications Facilities. 6. The minimum height limit of properties within the Employment Priority Combining Zone is one hundred seventy-five (175) feet. 7. Buildings constructed to accommodate Essential Service, Utility and Vehicular, or Extensive Impact Civic Activities as principal activities are exempted from the height minimum regulation. The allowed projections into the height limits contained in Section 17.108.030 are not counted towards the height minimum. 8. The minimum height of the base can be reduced to allow transition to a lower scale neighboring Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) or Designated Historic Property (DHP). 9. These required setbacks are in Table 17.101K.04 and include Note 3 of that table. Also, see Section 17.108.030 for allowed projections above height limits. 10. See 17.101K.130(A)(1)(b) and 17.101K.130(A)(1)(c) for more tower and base requirements. 11. The average floor area of the stories above the base cannot exceed this percentage of lot area, with the following two qualifications: a. The floor area of an individual story cannot be more than fifteen percent (15%) greater than the maximum average per story floor area above base. b. A story that is more than

--- Chunk 973 ---
fifteen percent (15%) less than the maximum average floor area is not included in the average per story floor area above the base. 12. This regulation does not apply in the Employment Priority Combining Zone. 13. For the purpose of this regulation, a “residential building” means a building with at least two-thirds (2/3) floor area designated for Residential Activities. --- Page 598 --- OAKLAND 598 14. For the purpose of this regulation, a “nonresidential building” means a building with more than one- third (1/3) floor area devoted to Nonresidential Activities. 15. The following additional regulations apply to the tower stepback: a. Unenclosed recreational, landscaping, and open space facilities are permitted within this stepback area. b. A lesser stepback is permitted if it precludes the construction of the maximum average per story lot coverage. c. For nonresidential towers, a stepback is only required on sites adjacent to a right of way that is less than eighty (80) feet. B. Community Benefit Contributions. 1. In order to qualify for the ZIP to exceed the normally required base maximum height and intensity requirements contained in Table 17.101K.05, applicants must provide the community benefits and comply with the requirements of this Subsection. An applicant

--- Chunk 974 ---
may provide any combination of the benefits identified in this Subsection. 2. The amount of community benefits and/or fees required per incentive depends on in which ZIP Benefit Area the project is located and whether the project is receiving a residential incentive (increase in maximum permitted dwelling units) or a commercial incentive (increase in maximum permitted nonresidential floor area). The Residential and Commercial ZIP Benefit Areas are designated on the Zoning Maps. 3. The increase in the maximum permitted dwelling units and/or nonresidential floor area depends on the amount of community benefits and/or ZIP fees provided, as shown in Tables 17.101K.07 and 17.101K.08. Regardless of the community benefit contribution, the number of dwelling units or amount of nonresidential floor area cannot exceed the maximums prescribed in Subsection A (Table 17.101K.06). 4. The applicant shall provide one or more of the community benefits described in Subsections a(i-iv) to participate in the ZIP. The additional development potential earned by providing these community benefits is in Tables 17.101K.07 and 17.101K.08. a. Types of Community Benefits i. Funding for Affordable Housing, Infrastructure Improvements, and Employment Training. Fees charged to a developer placed as allocated below in the following funds for the following purposes: 1.

--- Chunk 975 ---
Fifty percent (50%) of the contribution goes into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund as described in OMC Chapter 15.72; 2. Twenty-five percent (25%) of the contribution goes into the Economic and Workforce Development Miscellaneous Fee Revenue Account to provide employment training and services, prioritizing residents harmed by racial income and unemployment disparities. Fifty percent (50%) of these funds are dedicated for construction training and apprenticeships programs. 3. Twenty-five percent (25%) of the contribution goes into the Economic and Workforce Development Miscellaneous Fee Revenue Account to provide the Downtown improvements. This funding shall be used to implement public streetscape, open space, and/or flood control improvements that are consistent with the Downtown Oakland Specific Plan. ii. Below-Market Commercial Space. On site, ground floor space provided at fifty (50) --- Page 599 --- OAKLAND 599 percent of market rental rate for qualified retail, commercial, arts, and non-profit tenants that meet the City’s tenanting priorities for tenants that achieve the City’s goals to reduce racial inequities. In the BAMBD Arts and Culture Combining Zone (see Section 17.101K.010), such tenants should also meet the intent of the district. A development requires a minimum of five hundred (500) square feet of commercial space to qualify for

--- Chunk 976 ---
this incentive. In all such cases the applicant shall execute a written agreement with the City setting forth the square footage of all such affordable commercial space, restricting the occupancy and rent or sale price of such space, and setting forth other terms and conditions as required for ensuring compliance with this Section. Commercial space shall remain affordable for fifty-five (55) years or for the life of the development project, whichever is greater. Said agreement shall be recorded against the commercial space as covenants running with the land, senior in priority to any private liens or encumbrances, and shall be enforceable by the City against the applicant or the applicant's successors-in-interest to the property for the full affordability term. Additional restrictions, deeds of trust, rights of first refusal, or other instruments may be required by the City Administrator as reasonably needed to enforce these restrictions. iii. Public Restrooms. On-site, ground floor, gender-neutral restroom facilities that are open to the public at least between 8:30am and 6:00pm each day of the week. iv. Streetscape, Open Space, and Flood Control Improvements. Public streetscape and/or open space improvements, provided by the developer, that are consistent with improvements called for in the Downtown Oakland

--- Chunk 977 ---
Specific Plan. These improvements shall not include those generally required as part of a project approval in the D-DT Zone. The benefit may include pedestrian right-of-way and open space improvements such as plaza construction, landscaping, tree planting, and public art installation, plazas, street furniture, and other items that create an inviting public realm and, where applicable, support the development of cultural districts. Improvements may also include the implementation of flood control improvements in the Sea Level Rise Combining Zone that serve areas beyond the project site. b. Tables 17.101K.07 and 17.101K.08, below, contain the residential and nonresidential development potential, respectively, earned beyond the base amount (i.e., additional dwelling units and/or nonresidential floor area) by providing community benefits. The stated amount of benefit earns either the additional residential units described in Table 17.101K.07 or the additional nonresidential floor area described in Table 17.101K.08, or a combination of these. However, the stated amount of benefit cannot be “double counted” to earn the full amount of both residential and commercial benefits. For instance, providing 100 square feet of Below- Market Commercial Space can earn 1.3 additional dwelling units over the base permitted in Area R-A or 1,318 square feet of additional nonresidential floor

--- Chunk 978 ---
area over the base permitted in Area C-A, but not both. --- Page 600 --- OAKLAND 600 Table 17.101K.07 Residential ZIP Benefits: Community Benefits Required to Earn Additional Residential Units, by ZIP Benefit Area Benefit Increment Provided Number of Dwelling Units Permitted Above the Base Benefit Increment Provided Benefit Area R-A Benefit Area R- B Area R-C $15,000 Funding for Affordable Housing, Infrastructure Improvements and Employment Training (See Notes 1., 2., 3., and 8) 0.7 additional market-rate dwelling units above the base maximum 1.0 additional market-rate dwelling units above the base maximum 1.25 additional market-rate dwelling units above the base maximum 100 Square Feet of Below-Market Commercial Space (See Notes 2., 3., 4., and 8) 1.3 dwelling units 1.9 dwelling units 2.4 dwelling units Two or More Public Restrooms (See Notes 5, 6., and 8) 41 dwelling units 60 dwelling units 75 dwelling units $150,000 in Streetscape, Open Space, and Flood Control Improvements (See Notes 2, 3, 7., and 8) 7 dwelling units 10 dwelling units 12.5 dwelling units Notes: 1.

Providing an additional benefit would require an increment of at least $15,000 worth of additional funding. 2. Every July 1st beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of benefit for these items shall be adjusted upward annually at the rate of inflation in accordance with the percentage increase from January to January in the building cost index published by Marshall and Swift, or if such index ceases to be published, by an equivalent index chosen by the City Administrator, with appropriate adjustments for regional and local construction costs, as necessary. The adjustment shall be automatically effective regardless of whether the Master Fee Schedule has been amended to reflect the adjustment. 3. When the amount of Funding for Funding for Affordable Housing, Infrastructure Improvements and Employment Training, Below-Market Commercial Space, or Streetscape, Open Space, and Floor Control Improvements results in a fractional number of additional dwelling units permitted above the base, the number of units permitted above the base is rounded up to the nearest whole number. 4. Additional dwelling units are only permitted for each increment of 100 Square Feet of Below-Market

At least 1,000 square feet of Below-Market Commercial Space must be provided to qualify for additional nonresidential floor area above the base. Additional nonresidential floor area above the base is only permitted for each increment of 100 Square Feet of Below-Market Commercial Space. For instance, 150 square feet of Below-Market Commercial Space in a project does not provide any more nonresidential floor area above the base than 100 square feet. An additional benefit would require an additional increment of at least 100 more

--- Chunk 983 ---
square feet. 4. The additional nonresidential floor area above the base shown in this row of the table is the maximum permitted for providing public restrooms, regardless of the number of public restrooms provided. 5. Every July 1st beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of additional floor area permitted through providing two public restrooms shall be adjusted downward annually at the rate of inflation in accordance with the percentage increase from January to January in the building cost index published by Marshall and Swift, or if such index ceases to be published, by an equivalent index chosen by the City Administrator, with appropriate adjustments for regional and local construction costs, as necessary.

Additional nonresidential floor area above the base only permitted for each increment of $150,000 of investment in Streetscape, Open Space, and Flood Control Improvements. For instance, $200,000 worth of improvements does not allow any more floor area above the base than $150,000. Additional benefits would require an additional increment of at least $150,000. 17.101K.120 – Increased density and floor area ratio through the transfer of development

--- Chunk 984 ---
rights in the D-DT Zones. A. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this Section: 1. “Development Rights” means the maximum allowed dwelling units and floor area established in the zoning regulations for a specific lot. 2. “Net Development Rights” means the difference between: 1) the development rights on a lot, and 2) the existing floor area and number of dwelling units on the same lot. For example, if the underlying zoning permits a maximum of fifty (50) dwelling units on a lot, and the same lot contains forty (40) dwelling units, then the net development rights for density available for transfer is ten (10) dwelling units. 3. “Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)” means the transfer of some or all of the net development rights from a sending site to a designated receiving site, resulting in an increase in the number of dwelling units and/or amount of floor area than would otherwise be permitted at the receiving site. For example, a transfer of development rights for number of dwelling units has occurred if the sending site described in definition (2), above, transfers all its net development rights to allow a receiving site to construct ten (10) dwelling units more than

--- Chunk 985 ---
normally permitted in the zoning regulations. In this case, the sending site would not be permitted to contain more than the existing forty (40) dwelling units, because it transferred the site’s net development rights to the receiving site. 4. Receiving Site. A development site that receives net development rights from a sending site. 5. Sending Site. A lot that sends some or all its net development rights to another proposed development site. --- Page 603 --- OAKLAND 603 B. A transfer of development rights from a sending site to a receiving site in a D-DT Zone is only permitted if it meets the requirements of this section. This section shall supersede the regulations contained in Section 17.106.050. C. Development rights from a single sending site may be transferred as a group to a single receiving site or in separate increments to several receiving sites. Development rights may be transferred from the original owner of the development rights to either: 1) the owner of a receiving site, or 2) to an entity(s) that holds them for subsequent transfer to the owner(s) of a receiving site(s). D. Prior to the transfer of development rights, the owner of the sending site shall submit

--- Chunk 986 ---
for approval by the Bureau of Planning, in consultation with the Office of Cultural Heritage Survey, a maintenance plan. The plan shall describe any proposed preservation work that guarantees the maintenance and upkeep of the sending site. This plan shall include: 1. A plan for the ongoing maintenance for the sending site, including clearing any outstanding Notices of Violation; 2. Information regarding the nature and cost of any preservation work to be conducted on the sending site, including information about any required seismic, life safety, or disability access work; and 3. Any other information that the Bureau of Planning requires to determine compliance to this subsection. E. For any transfers of development rights, the owners of the sending site shall prepare and execute an agreement, approved as to form and legality by the City Attorney and filed with the Alameda County Recorder under the addresses of both the receiving and sending sites, incorporating the restricted development rights at the sending site, the plan described in Subsection D, and the expanded development rights at the receiving site. F. After the transfer of development rights, the principal building(s) on the sending site shall not be demolished unless there is an imminent danger

--- Chunk 987 ---
to health and safety as determined by the Building Official. G. Characteristics of the sending and receiving sites. 1. Both the receiving and sending sites must be within a D-DT Zone. 2. The sending site shall be at least one of the following: 1) a Designated Historic Property (DHP); 2) a Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) that contributes to an Area of Secondary Importance (ASI) or Area of Primary Importance (API); or 3) a property rated “A” or “B” by the Office of the Cultural Heritage Survey. 3. The receiving site shall be neither: 1) a Designated Historic Property (DHP); 2) a Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) that contributes to an Area of Secondary Importance (ASI) or Area of Primary Importance (API); nor 3) a property rated “A” or “B” by the Office of the Cultural Heritage Survey. 4. A receiving site being granted additional density over the base must be in a location that permits Residential Facilities, and a receiving site being granted additional nonresidential floor area over the base must be at a location that permits Enclosed Nonresidential Facilities. H. Relationship to the Zoning Incentive Program and the State Density Bonus Law. 1. The number of units and/or

--- Chunk 988 ---
floor area greater than what is permitted under the base density at a receiving site achieved through a transfer of development rights shall not be more than half of the maximum of what could be achieved through the D-DT Zoning Incentive Program (see Section 17.101K.110 for the ZIP regulations) . For example, if the ZIP allows twenty (20) more units and fifty thousand (50,000) more square feet than what is normally allowed by the base intensity regulations at a site, then the maximum a --- Page 604 --- OAKLAND 604 transfer of development rights can achieve is ten (10) units and twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet over what is allowed under the base intensity at the site. 2. The intensity achieved through the TDR program plus the intensity achieved under the ZIP shall not exceed the maximum permitted under the ZIP. 3. If an applicant chooses to utilize both the TDR program and the State Density Bonus Law, the State Density Bonus is calculated from the new base density established through the TDR, plus any additional development generated under the Zoning Incentive Program. I. Construction at a receiving site above the maximum height that is permitted in the applicable base

--- Chunk 989 ---
zone are only permitted upon the granting of Regular Design Review Approval. This increase over the maximum height shall meet both of the following requirements: a. The additional height shall be limited to only that required to physically accommodate the transferred net development rights. The additional height required to accommodate the transferred development rights shall be based on the average size of the dwelling units (including common hallways) at the sending site and the nonresidential floor area transferred to the receiving site. 17.101K.130 – General Design Standards A. The following regulations apply to newly constructed principal buildings, with the exception of new industrial buildings. 1. Ground Floor Treatment a. Entrance. Buildings shall have at least one prominent pedestrian entrance on the ground floor facing and oriented toward the street on the principal street façade (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal street). Entrances at building corners facing both the principal street and a secondary street may be used to satisfy this requirement. Building entrances include doors to one or more shops, businesses, lobbies, or living units. Entrances shall be made prominent through some combination of change in material, an awning above a door, additional detailing and transparency surrounding

--- Chunk 990 ---
the entrance, stairs leading to the door, and other features. The entrance for Nonresidential Facilities shall be at grade. Entrances shall be recessed at least three (3) feet from the façade of all buildings. b. Ground Floor Materials. All ground-floor building materials shall be durable, of high quality, and display a sense of permanence. Such materials include stone, poured concrete, tile, brick, metal panel systems, glass, and/or other similar materials. c. Distinguishing Ground Floor. The ground level of the building shall be designed to enhance the visual experience for pedestrians and distinguish it from upper stories. This shall be achieved by designing a ground floor facade that is distinct from the rest of the building through some combination of two or more of the following: change of material, enhanced detailing, cornices, awnings, canopies, and/or other elements. d. Ground Floor Commercial Façade Elements. For buildings with ground floor commercial space, the ground floor shall be modulated into a regular cadence of storefront-sized windows and entrances and contain a window base or kickplate, and transom windows. The design of these elements shall be consistent with the style of the building. Ground floor commercial facades shall be within five (5) feet of the

--- Chunk 991 ---
front property line. e. Active Space Requirement. Parking spaces; locker areas; utility, storage, and trash rooms; and similar non-active spaces shall not be located within thirty (30) feet from the principal ground floor street facade, except for incidental entrances to such activities elsewhere in the --- Page 605 --- OAKLAND 605 building. Exceptions to this requirement can be made through the Design Review Procedure (See Chapter 17.136). Proposals requiring Regular Design Review approval may only be granted upon determination that the proposal conforms to the criteria contained in Section 17.136.050, and to both of the following additional criteria: i. There is no other feasible location for the non-active space and the amount of non-active space in the front thirty (30) feet of the building is minimized to the maximum amount practically achievable; and ii. When feasible, active space is placed between the non-active space and the street. f. Trash and Storage. Trash and storage shall be in the garage, underground, or be otherwise concealed from view of the public right-of-way. Trash and storage shall not be placed adjacent to the principal street facade unless the proposal is on an interior lot (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal

--- Chunk 992 ---
street). g. Utilities. Backflow prevention devices and utility meters shall not be placed on the principal street façade unless the proposal is on an interior lot (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal street). These elements shall be placed in a building alcove, underground, landscaped area, or utility room, and completely screened from view from the public right-of-way unless required otherwise by a department of the City. Whenever feasible, transformers shall be placed out of public view and not on the principal street facade. If this is infeasible, transformers shall be screened by landscaping. Transformers shall never be placed above ground in the right-of-way. h. Parking and Loading Access Location. Access to parking and loading facilities through driveways, garage doors, or other means shall not be from the principal street when alternative access is feasible from a secondary street facade or an alley (see Section 17.101K.080 for how to identify the principal street). Open parking areas shall not be located between the sidewalk and a principal building. 2. Base Design. a. Transition to Historic Buildings. The design of the building base shall create a transition to adjacent lower scale Designated Historic Properties (DHPs) and Potentially Designated Historic Properties

--- Chunk 993 ---
(PDHPs). This shall be accomplished through matching cornice lines, floor heights and other building elements, and creating volumes at the façade of the base that relate to the scale of the historic building. b. Building Base Articulation. The façade(s) of the base that are more than seventy-five (75) feet in width and visible from the street shall use both vertical and horizontal plane offsets, articulations, and material changes that create shadow and relief. c. For buildings with a clear pattern of individual ground floor residential unit entrances: wherever feasible, articulate and modulate the principal facade of the building base to correspond to the entrances. d. Windows and Façade Treatment. Each building base façade facing a street shall contain windows. Expanses of solid walls without windows on these facades shall not exceed ten (10) feet in width. However, wider solid walls required by the Building Code for structural purposes are permitted. e. For corner buildings, design the building base to emphasize the intersection of two streets right-of-ways that are both eighty (80) feet or wider in width through a combination of building corner architectural detailing such as added transparency, particularly floor to ceiling windows, a corner entrances, articulation, and high-quality materials,

--- Chunk 994 ---
and chamfering the corner. f. Parking, loading, or circulation located above the ground floor shall be lined by habitable floor area along all street frontages. If the applicant demonstrates that this is not feasible, parking, --- Page 606 --- OAKLAND 606 loading or circulation located above the ground floor shall screened from the street with a façade treatment that is integrated into the design of the building façade(s). 3. Tower Design. The following standards apply to towers, which is defined as construction above the base of a building. a. Each façade shall include some combination of fenestration, sculpting, volumes, articulation, and/or material patterns to reduce the perception of building mass and avoid the appearance of repeated identical floors. b. For tower facades over one-hundred and fifty (150) feet in width, provide a change in massing by providing one or more articulations, stepbacks, or notches greater than twenty (20) feet wide and ten (10) feet deep to reduce apparent building bulk. c. Design Integration with Base. Vertically integrate with and/or extend design elements of a tower to building the base façade facing the street. This technique shall be used to avoid the appearance of towers being isolated from the street and

--- Chunk 995 ---
the base. d. Windows. Each visible tower facade shall contain windows, including façades facing interior and rear property lines. Expanses of solid walls without windows that are visible from the street shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in width. e. Building Terminus. The top of buildings shall include elements that provide a distinct visual terminus. The visual terminus shall be integrated into the overall architectural design concept of the building as seen in the skyline. Examples include, but are not limited to, curvilinear or stepped forms that soften the truncated tops of buildings, cornices, symmetric volumes toward the middle of the roof, and other architectural forms. These rooftop elements shall be sized, shaped, and sited to also screen all rooftop mechanical equipment from view. 4. General building design requirements. a. Massing. The mass of buildings shall be broken up into smaller forms to reduce the scale and enhance the visual interest of the streetscape. The massing requirements contained in this section shall be applied on all visible facades and achieved through a coordinated combination of two or more of the following: changes in plane, sculpting, building articulation, varied materials, contrasting window patterns and treatments, varying roof heights, separating upper-story floor

--- Chunk 996 ---
area into two or more towers, contrasting colors, a distinct base, middle, and top, or other methods. b. Heavily tinted bronze, black, or gray glass shall not predominate on or be a signature feature of facades. 17.101K.140 – Development Standards for New Construction on Lots Adjacent to the Lake Merritt Channel A. The regulations of this section apply to the new construction of principal buildings on parcels that are adjacent to the Lake Merritt Channel or its adjacent open space. B. The following definition only applies to this Section: 1. Lake Merritt Channel Facade - Lake Merritt Channel Facade refers to the façade and private and public space that abuts either: 1) the Lake Merritt Channel; or 2) existing and/or planned parks and open spaces that border the Lake Merritt Channel. C. No building shall be constructed within sixty (60) feet of the top of the bank of the Lake Merritt Channel. D. In addition to the findings required in Chapter 17.136, the following Regular Design Review findings are required to be met for all development projects that include the construction of a new principal building on a lot that is adjacent to the Lake Merritt Channel open space area:

--- Chunk 997 ---
--- Page 607 --- OAKLAND 607 1. The project contributes to and protects the unique environmental resources at the Channel and coordinates with ongoing and proposed capital improvements and restoration projects associated with the Lake Merritt Channel. 2. The project landscaping integrates with and visually transitions to existing or planned adjacent natural and open spaces. 3. The Lake Merritt Channel façade provides visual interest for pedestrians at the Lake Merritt Channel. E. New development shall comply with the following building orientation, facade, and landscape requirements: 1. Whenever feasible, no Lake Merritt Channel Facade shall include utility meters, utility boxes, or vehicle entryways. If it is unavoidable to place utility meters and/or boxes on the Lake Merritt Channel Façade, they shall be screened by dense landscaping. No garages shall face the channel, and at least one prominent entrance shall face the channel. 2. Developments shall include open spaces in the form of walkways, landscaped passive recreation areas or terraced plazas between the Lake Merritt Channel Facades and the Channel. 17.101K.150 – Usable Open Space Standards A. General. This Section contains the usable open space standards and requirements for residential development in the D-DT Zones. These requirements shall supersede those in Chapter

--- Chunk 998 ---
17.126. B. Definitions of D-DT usable open space types. The following includes a list of available usable open space types eligible to fulfill the usable space requirements of this Chapter and the definitions of these types of open space: 1. "Private Usable Open Space". Private usable open space is accessible from a single unit and may be provided in a combination of recessed and projecting exterior spaces. 2. "Public Ground-Level Plaza". Public ground-level plazas (plazas) are group usable open space located at street-level and adjacent to the building frontage. Plazas are publicly accessible during daylight hours and are maintained by the property owner. Plazas shall be landscaped and include pedestrian and other amenities, such as benches, fountains and special paving. 3. "Rooftop Open Space". Rooftop open space, a type of group usable open space, includes gardens, decks, swimming pools, spas and landscaping located on the rooftop and accessible to all tenants. 4. "Courtyard". A courtyard is a type of group usable open space that can be located anywhere within the subject property. C. Standards. All required usable open space shall be permanently maintained and shall conform to the following standards: 1. Area. On each lot containing Residential Facilities with a

Failure to timely file an appeal will waive any rights to further challenge the City's determination contained in the notice of amortization. 4. Appeal Fee. Established per master fee schedule. Appellants shall be allowed to file one (1) appeal and pay one (1) appeal fee where the City Administrator determines that similar issues are raised and the payment of multiple fees would be unreasonable. 5. Notification of Completeness. The City will notify appellant within forty-five (45) business days of appeal submittal whether the appeal application is deemed complete. City failure to notify appellant within said time period will deem the application complete. This does not preclude the City from requesting additional information after

--- Chunk 1129 ---
the application has been deemed complete. 6. Written Determination. The City will provide appellant with a written decision within ninety (90) days of receipt of a complete appeal application, unless an extension is agreed to by the appellant. Request by the City for additional information after the application has been deemed complete will not modify the timing of the ninety (90) day period during which the written determination is being made, provided that the appellant responds in a timely manner to the City request. Failure of the City to timely issue a written decision shall result in granting of the appeal. 7. Decision Final. The written decision of the City Administrator is final and not administratively appealable. (Ord. No. 13112, § 4(Exh. A), 4-30-2012; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh.

In all Commercial and Industrial Zones, as well as the RU-4, RU-5, S-1, S-3, and S-15 Zones, any Commercial, Industrial, or mixed use building or complex containing two (2) or more tenant spaces on site may apply for a Master Sign Program which specifies the overall design, configuration, and permitted sizes of Signs for that building or complex. Applications for a Master Sign Program shall identify, at a minimum, the permitted sign sizes, materials, colors, placement, construction, method of lighting, and other related sign requirements for the applicable Commercial, Industrial, or mixed use building or complex. Drawings shall indicate the exterior surface details of all buildings on the site; the typical sign locations, designs, colors, and faces; and the methods of sign construction, installation, and lighting. B. Use Permit Criteria. A Master Sign Program may be allowed to deviate from the normally required sign standards in this Chapter, including but not limited to, total aggregate sign area. A Master Sign Program application which would deviate from the normally required sign standards shall be processed

--- Chunk 1131 ---
as a conditional use permit under the provisions of Chapter 17.134. A conditional use permit for a Master Sign Program may only be granted upon determination that the proposed sign program conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134 and to all of the following additional use permit criteria: 1. That the proposal will be of a quality and character appropriate to the Commercial, Industrial, mixed use building or complex; 2. That the building facade and other walls will be considered and treated as a whole, and in relationship to adjoining buildings; 3. That all Signs will be harmonious with the architectural design of the building and adjacent buildings, and will not cover or detract from a building's significant architectural features. C. Review of Individual Signs Upon Approval of a Master Sign Program. Once a Master Sign Program is approved for any multi-tenant building or complex, the following provisions shall apply: 1. Sign applications determined to conform to the provisions of an approved Master Sign Program shall be exempt from design review as is otherwise specified in Chapter 17.136. 2. Sign applications determined to not conform to an approved Master

parcel contains two (2) or more existing principal buildings which were lawfully established, said parcel may be divided into two (2) or more lots which do not have the minimum lot area, minimum lot width, and minimum frontage, yards, open space, and parking requirements otherwise applying to the divided lots may be waived or modified upon the granting of a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to the Conditional Use Permit procedure in Chapter 17.134. Each resulting lot shall accommodate at least one existing principal building and each lot shall have frontage on a street. A Conditional Use Permit may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria in Chapter 17.134 and to the following special criteria: 1. That all principal structures existed lawfully under the previous zoning controls, and are habitable or in sound condition; 2. That the proposal will not result in a lot which is so small, so shaped, or so situated that it would be impractical for subsequent permitted uses; 3. That the proposal will maintain the existing amount of usable open space and off- street parking spaces for any Residential Facilities involved. If there are more parking spaces or usable

open space on the lot than required, then the number of parking spaces and/or amount of open space can be reduced to the minimum required. C. Division of Parcel under State Law SB 684. Where a project is subject to State law SB 684, as codified under California Government Code Sections 65852.28 and 66499.41, and said parcel is no larger than five (5) acres and shall be subdivided into ten (10) or fewer lots for a for-sale housing units development project, the minimum lot development standards prescribed in the applicable individual zone regulations shall be subject to the --- Page 670 --- OAKLAND 670 following exceptions: 1. The resulting parcels of an SB 684 subdivision shall have a minimum lot size of six hundred (600) square feet, and the minimum lot width and minimum lot frontage dimensional requirements otherwise prescribed shall not apply. 2. Interior side setbacks are not required between units of an SB 684 subdivision. 3. A minimum rear setback of four (4) feet is required for each SB 684 lot; and a minimum street side setback of four (4) feet or the setback for the underlying zone, whichever is less, is required between SB 684 lots and

adjacent streets. 4. A minimum side yard setback of four (4) feet or the setback for the underlying zone, whichever is less, is required between SB 684 lots and adjacent lots not part of the SB 684 subdivision. 5. For SB 684 subdivisions creating three (3) to seven (7) units, the maximum floor area ration (FAR) allowed shall be no less than 1.0; and for SB 684 subdivisions creating eight (8) to ten (10) units, the maximum FAR allowed shall be no less than 1.25. This subparagraph shall only apply where the Oakland Planning Code otherwise imposes a residential floor area ratio and shall not be interpreted as establishing a residential floor area requirement where none exists.

Notwithstanding the requirements prescribed in the applicable individual zone regulations with respect to minimum lot width mean and minimum frontage upon a street, a lot which does not meet such requirements may be created and/or developed in each of the following situations: A. If it has a frontage of not less than twenty (20) feet

--- Chunk 1136 ---
upon an undedicated vehicular way, other than one similar in function to an alley or path, which has a right-of-way not less than forty (40) feet in width and which was shown on the sewer maps on file with the City Engineer on the effective date of the zoning regulations; B. If it is served by a private access easement approved pursuant to the real estate subdivision regulations and subject to the provisions of Section 17.102.090; C. If it consists of a parcel of contiguous land which existed lawfully under the previous zoning controls; D. If it meets the same conditions as are prescribed in Section 17.106.010 for lot area and width exceptions; E.

For mixed use projects in all zones, the allowable intensity of development shall be measured according to both the maximum nonresidential Floor Area Ratio (FAR) allowed by the zone and the maximum residential density allowed by the zone. The total lot area shall be used as a basis for computing both the maximum nonresidential FAR and the maximum residential density. B. Different Floor Area Ratios. In all zones in which the maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) generally prescribed for Residential Facilities is different from that for Nonresidential Facilities, the overall maximum FAR of any lot containing both Residential and Nonresidential Facilities shall be the greater of the two prescribed FARs. However, the total floor area actually devoted to each class of facility shall not exceed the maximum ratio prescribed for that class. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh.

That the applicant has acquired development rights from the owners of lots within three hundred (300) feet of the subject development site, restricting the number of living units or the amount of floor area which may be developed thereon so long as the facilities proposed by the applicant are in existence; B. That the owners of all such nearby lots shall prepare and execute an agreement, approved as to form and legality by the City Attorney and filed with the Alameda County Recorder, incorporating such restriction; --- Page 672 --- OAKLAND 672 C. That the resultant reduction in potential number of living units or amount of floor area on such nearby lots is sufficient in amount and is so located as to cause the net effect upon the surrounding neighborhood

--- Chunk 1140 ---
to be substantially equivalent to that of the development which would be allowable otherwise.

the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date a density bonus application is received, or, if elected by the developer, a lesser percentage of density increase, including, but not limited to, no increase in density. The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the number of target living units that must be affordable to the relevant income group. For purposes of this definition, unless otherwise specified in the specific plan or its implementing zoning regulations, where a specific plan includes a separate provision that allows for a density bonus, including through a Conditional Use Permit, a developer cannot receive a density bonus under both this Chapter and under the specific plan. G. Developer. “Developer” shall mean the owner or owner’s authorized agent, or other person, including a lessee, having the right under the Oakland zoning ordinance, to make an application for development approvals for the development, or redevelopment, of a housing development project.

An application for a density bonus and/or related incentive(s) and waiver(s) shall be submitted concurrently with the application for a planning entitlement for a housing development and shall be processed and considered as part of the same. B. The density bonus application shall be accompanied by such information including, but not limited to, site and building plans, drawings and elevations, and operational data, as may be required to permit the review of the proposal in the context of the required findings, and any additional information deemed necessary by the Director of Planning to permit the review of the

--- Chunk 1149 ---
proposal in the context of the required findings. C. No density bonus application shall be determined to be complete until the following have been provided: 1. A written statement specifying the total base dwelling units, target living units, desired density bonus, incentive(s) and/or waiver(s) requested, and the type, location, size and construction scheduling of all living units; 2. Payment of all fees for the application as set forth in the Master Fee Schedule; 3. If an incentive is requested, a narrative explanation as to the actual cost reduction achieved, stated in a dollar amount, and how the cost reduction would result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable rent or affordable housing costs for the target living units; 4. If a waiver is requested, a narrative and diagrammatic explanation demonstrating that the application of any development standard for which a waiver is requested would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the development at the density and with the incentives permitted by this Chapter. Information should include narrative descriptions, analyses, and architectural diagrams that clearly articulate how many units would be lost due to the application of the specific development standard(s). Where more than one

--- Chunk 1150 ---
waiver is sought, the application should clearly demonstrate why the waivers are cumulatively necessary to prevent a development standard from physically precluding the construction of the development. 5. If an incentive or waiver is requested, submittal of information sufficient to allow the City to assess whether any of the requested inventive(s) or waiver(s) will have a specific adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, or if there is such an impact, an analysis of potential methods to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the residential housing development unaffordable to moderate-, low-, and very low-income households, and the feasibility of such methods. 6. If the application is for approval of mixed use where the mix of uses would not otherwise be allowed, evidence that the proposed non-residential use will reduce the cost of the residential housing development and that the non-residential use is --- Page 677 --- OAKLAND 677 compatible with the proposed residential housing development and other existing or planned development in the area where the proposed residential housing development will be located. 7. Information determined necessary to demonstrate compliance with the replacement unit provisions described in

--- Chunk 1151 ---
section 17.107.045 and Government Code section 65915(c)(3), including a narrative description of any prior residential use of the property and supporting documentation. 8. Any other such information as may be required to permit the review of the proposal in the context of the required findings, as requested by the Director of City Planning. 17.107.040 Density Bonus. A. The City shall grant one density bonus, the amount of which shall not exceed the amounts specified in the tables below, and, if requested, incentives in accordance with Section 17.107.080, waivers in accordance with Section 17.107.095, and parking ratio reductions in accordance with Section 17.107.120, when a developer agrees to construct a residential housing development with at least any one of the following categories: 1. Category 1 - Ten percent (10%) of the total base dwelling units of a residential housing development are made available as affordable housing for low income households; or 2. Category 2 - Five percent (5%) of the total base dwelling units of a residential housing development are made available as affordable housing for very low income households; or 3. Category 3 - A senior citizen housing development; or 4. Category 4 - Ten percent (10%) of the total

--- Chunk 1152 ---
base dwelling units of a residential housing development are sold at affordable housing cost to persons and families of a low or moderate income, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase and not as rental units, except that a density bonus may also be granted for moderate-income rental units if and to the extent otherwise provided in the City of Oakland Affordable Housing Impact Fee Ordinance, Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 15.72; or 5. Category 5 - Ten percent (10%) of the total base dwelling units of a residential housing development are made available as affordable housing for transitional foster use, as defined in Section 66025.9 of the California Education Code, disabled veterans, as defined in Section 18541 of the California Government Code, or homeless persons, as defined in the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.

Category 6 - Twenty percent (20%) of the total base dwelling units are made available as affordable housing for lower income students in a student housing development that meets all of the

--- Chunk 1153 ---
requirements contained in subdivision (b)(1)(F) of California Government Code Section 65915; or 7. Category 7 - One hundred percent (100%) of all dwelling units, including total base dwelling units and density bonus units but exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, of a residential housing development are made available as affordable housing for lower income households, except that up to twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units, --- Page 678 --- OAKLAND 678 including total based dwelling units and density bonus units may be made available for moderate income households. B. For residential housing developments meeting Category 1 above, the density bonus shall be calculated as indicated in Table 17.107.01: Table 17.107.01: Density Bonus for Providing Units for Low Income Households Percentage Low-Income Units Percentage Density Bonus 10 20 11 21.5 12 23 13 24.5 14 26 15 27.5 16 29 17 30.5 18 32 19 33.5 20 35 21 38.75 22 42.5 23 46.75 24 50 Source: California Government Code, Section 65915(f)(1).

For senior citizen housing developments meeting Category 3 in Subsection A. above, the density bonus shall be twenty percent (20%) of the number of senior housing units. Any density bonus granted under this Chapter shall be separate from, and not combined with, the City of Oakland Senior Housing Density Bonus which, if a conditional use permit is approved, permits an increase of seventy-five percent (75%) more senior housing units than are permitted by zoning, as described in Section 17.106.060. E. For residential housing developments meeting Category 4 in Subsection A. above, the density bonus shall be calculated as indicated in Table 17.107.03.

For transitional housing developments meeting Category 5 in Subsection A. above, the density bonus shall be twenty percent (20%) of the number of units of the type giving rise to a density bonus under Category 5. G. For student housing developments meeting Category 6 in Subsection A. above, the density bonus shall be thirty-five percent (35%) of the number of total student housing units. H. For housing developments meeting Category 7 in Subsection A. above, the following shall apply: 1. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection H.2. below, the density bonus shall be eighty percent (80%) of the number of units for lower income households. 2. If the residential housing development is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, the developer may seek a waiver requesting that no maximum controls on density apply and shall also receive a height increase of up to three additional stories or 33 feet. A

--- Chunk 1156 ---
qualifying residential housing development seeking a waiver from any maximum controls on density shall not be eligible for, and shall not receive, any additional waivers. 3. Rents for all dwelling units in housing developments meeting Category 7, including the density bonus units, shall be set such that the rent for at least twenty percent (20%) of the dwelling units are set at an affordable rent, as defined in Section 50053 of the Health and Safety Code, and the rent for the remaining units in the housing development are set at an amount consistent with the maximum rent levels for a housing development that receives an allocation of state or federal low-income housing tax credits from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. I. The developer shall elect whether the density bonus shall be awarded on the basis of Category 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 in Subsection A. above. The developer may elect to accept a lesser percentage of density bonus, including no increase in density. All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a

--- Chunk 1157 ---
General Plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. The density bonus shall not be included when determining the number of target living units that must be affordable to the relevant income group. J. Determination of the number of target living units required to be included in an eligible residential housing development and the number of density bonus units shall be calculated as follows: 1. Prior to submission of a density bonus application, the developer shall review the applicable zoning standards in the Oakland Planning Code and the instructions included on the supplemental application for density bonus to determine the maximum allowable residential density for the site proposed for the residential housing development. 2. The developer shall then provide information on the proposed total base dwelling units and the category in Subsection A. above under which the developer proposes for the density bonus to be awarded. The developer shall state how many of the proposed total base dwelling units will meet the requirements of the category selected. 3. The developer shall then provide information regarding any dwelling units currently existing at the site proposed for the residential housing development as determined by staff as necessary to ensure no replacement units

--- Chunk 1158 ---
must be included prior to --- Page 682 --- OAKLAND 682 eligibility for a density bonus and related incentive(s) and waiver(s), as described further in Section 17.107.045. 4. The developer shall then calculate the density bonus for which its proposed residential housing development is eligible by multiplying the percentage of bonus units as described in Subsections B, C, D, E, G, and H above by the proposed total base dwelling units, rounding up the product. For Category 5, the percentage of bonus units shall be multiplied by the number of the type of units giving rise to the density bonus only, as described in Subsection F. 5. The developer shall then state whether it elects to include a lesser number of density bonus units in the proposed residential housing development, including the possibility of no density bonus units. 17.107.045 – Replacement units. A. A developer shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or waivers if the residential housing development is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject

--- Chunk 1159 ---
to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control, including but not limited to California anti-rent gouging protections (California Civil Code Section 1947.12) and the Oakland Rent Adjustment Ordinance (Oakland Municipal Code Sections 8.22.10 through 8.22.250); or occupied by lower or very low income households. B. Notwithstanding Subsection A. above, a developer shall remain eligible for a density bonus and related incentive(s) and waiver(s) if the conditions described in Subsection A. apply, the proposed residential housing development replaces those units, and either of the following applies: 1. The proposed residential housing development, inclusive of the units replaced pursuant to this section, contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in Section 17.107.040. 2. Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low income household. C. For purposes of this section, “replace” shall mean either of the following: 1. If any dwelling units described in Subsection A. are occupied on the date of application, the proposed residential housing development shall provide at

--- Chunk 1160 ---
least the same number of units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those households in occupancy. If the income category of the household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied the units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the City of Oakland as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (“HUD’s”) Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. For unoccupied dwelling units described in Subsection A. in a development with occupied units, the proposed residential housing development shall provide units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as the --- Page 683 --- OAKLAND 683 last household in occupancy. If the income category of the last household in occupancy is not known, it shall rebuttable presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income

--- Chunk 1161 ---
renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction as determined by the most recently available data from HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. 2. If all dwelling units described in Subsection A. have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the date of application, the proposed residential housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size as existed at the highpoint of those units in the five-year period preceding the application to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that time. If the income category of the household in occupancy at the highpoint is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that low- income and very low income renter households occupied the units in the same proportion of low-income and very low income renter households to all renter households within the City of Oakland as determined by the most recently available data from HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. 3. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If

--- Chunk 1162 ---
the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of Government Code Section 65915. 4. For purposes of this Section, “equivalent size” means that the replacement units contain at least the same total number of bedrooms, total number of bathrooms, and total square footage as the units being replaced. For purposes of replacing a unit in the form of a single-family home, “equivalent size” shall not require that the replacement unit include the same total square footage as the unit being replaced but still must contain at least the same total number of bedrooms and total number of bathrooms. 5. For purposes of this Section, the income category of the current or last household in occupancy shall be considered not known and the rebuttable presumptions above shall apply only when the developer includes as part of the density bonus application documentation, supported by a signed affidavit under penalty of perjury, of good faith efforts to determine the income category of that household. Documentation can include, but

--- Chunk 1163 ---
is not limited to, correspondence with the property management company, correspondence with the previous property owner, correspondence with existing tenants, or individual lease documentation and attachments. Documentation shall be redacted to protect tenant’s personal identifiable information. If the developer does not provide any documentation evidencing that the income category of the current or last household in occupancy is not known or does not provide a signed affidavit, it shall be rebuttably presumed that very low income renter households occupied the units. D. For any dwelling unit described in Subsection A that the developer proposes to replace, the developer shall comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 8.22, Residential Rent Adjustments and Evictions, including but not limited to relocation assistance. The developer shall, as a condition of receiving a certificate of occupancy, provide evidence to the satisfaction of the Director of Planning that the developer has --- Page 684 --- OAKLAND 684 provided relocation assistance to all displaced tenants consistent with the Oakland Uniform Relocation Ordinance and California Government Code Section 66300. 17.107.050 Land Donation. A. Eligibility. A project involving a land donation to the City shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this Section if all of

--- Chunk 1164 ---
the following conditions are met: 1. The developer donates and transfers the land to the City no later than the date of approval by the City of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application of the residential housing development seeking the density bonus. 2. The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the number of residential units of the proposed residential housing development seeking the density bonus. 3. The transferred land is characterized by the following: (a) It is at least one acre in size, or of sufficient size to permit development of at least forty (40) units; and (b) It has the appropriate General Plan designation and is appropriately zoned for affordable housing; and (c) It is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure; and (d) It shall have appropriate zoning and development standards to make the development of the affordable housing units feasible; and (e) No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application of the residential

--- Chunk 1165 ---
housing development seeking the density bonus, the transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very low income housing units on the transferred land, except that the City may subject the proposed residential housing development to subsequent design review, if the design is not reviewed by the City before the time of transfer. 4. The transferred land and the affordable housing units shall be subject to a deed restriction, which shall be recorded on the property at the time of dedication, ensuring continued affordability of the units for a term of at least fifty-five (55) years. 5. The land is transferred to the City or to another housing developer approved by the City. 6. The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed residential housing development or, if the City agrees, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed residential housing development. 7. A proposed source of funding for the construction of units affordable to very low income households shall be identified not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application. B. When a developer donates

--- Chunk 1166 ---
land to the City, the developer shall be entitled to an increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density for the entire residential housing development, as indicated in Table 17.107.04. --- Page 685 --- OAKLAND 685 Table 17.107.04: Land Donation Percentage Very Low Income Units Percentage Density Bonus 10 15 11 16 12 17 13 18 14 19 15 20 16 21 17 22 18 23 19 24 20 25 21 26 22 27 23 28 24 29 25 30 26 31 27 32 28 33 29 34 30 35 Source: California Government Code, Section 65915(g)(1). C. This density bonus shall be in addition to any Density Bonus mandated by Section 17.107.040; up to a maximum combined density increase of thirty-five percent (35%), if the developer seeks both the increase required under this section and the increase under Section 17.107.040. 17.107.060 Child Care Facilities. A. Residential Development. When a developer proposes to construct a residential housing development that conforms to the requirements of Section 17.107.040 (i.e. a density bonus), and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the residential housing development, the City shall grant either of the

--- Chunk 1167 ---
following: --- Page 686 --- OAKLAND 686 1. An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to, or greater than, the amount of square feet in the child care facility; or 2. An additional incentive approved by the City that would contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. B. Requirements. The City shall require, as a condition of approving the residential housing development, that the following occur: 1. The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as, or longer than, the period of time during which the affordable housing units are required to remain affordable pursuant to this article; and 2. Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income households, lower income households, moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is equal to, or greater than, the percentage of dwelling units that are made affordable to very low income households, lower income households, or families of moderate income households pursuant to Section 17.107.040. C. Commercial or Industrial Development. California Government Code (Section 65917.5) permits a density bonus

--- Chunk 1168 ---
when a child care facility is installed, operated and maintained in a commercial or industrial project, over the otherwise maximum allowable density or floor area ratio permitted under Oakland Planning Code and Land Use and Transportation Element of the Oakland General Plan. For purposes of this section only, “child care facility” means a facility installed, operated, and maintained under this Section for the nonresidential care of children as defined under applicable State licensing requirements for the facility. The density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 1. A maximum of five (5) square feet of floor area for each one square foot of floor area contained in the child care facility for existing structures. 2. A maximum of ten (10) square feet of floor area for each one square foot of floor area contained in the child care facility for new structures. For purposes of calculating the density or floor area bonus under this Section, both indoor and outdoor square footage requirements for the child care facility as set forth in applicable State child care licensing requirements shall be included in the floor area of the child care facility. D. Notwithstanding any requirement of this Section, the City shall not be

--- Chunk 1169 ---
required to provide a density or floor area bonus or incentive for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. Further, the provisions of California Government Code Section 65917.5 (Subsections c—e) shall apply in Oakland. 17.107.070 Condominium Conversions. A. Residential Development Project involving the conversion of existing apartments into condominiums, pursuant to Title 16 Oakland Subdivision Regulations, that includes at least thirty-three percent (33%) of its total units restricted to moderate income households for thirty (30) years, or fifteen percent (15%) of its total units affordable to Lower Income households for thirty (30) years, and agrees to pay for the administrative costs incurred by the City related to process the application and monitor the future status of the Affordable Housing Units, the City shall either: --- Page 687 --- OAKLAND 687 1. Grant a Density Bonus, increasing the number of residential units by twenty-five percent (25%) over the number of apartments, to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion; or 2. Provide other incentives of equivalent financial value to be determined by the City. For purposes of this Section, "other incentives of equivalent financial value"

--- Chunk 1170 ---
shall not be construed to require the City of Oakland to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation, but may include the reduction, or waiver, of requirements which the City might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval. B. An applicant for approval to convert apartments to a condominium project may submit to the City a preliminary proposal ("Pre-Application") pursuant to this Section prior to the submittal of any formal requests for subdivision map approvals. The City shall, within ninety (90) days of receipt of a written proposal, notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which it will comply with this Section. C. An applicant shall be ineligible for a condominium conversion density bonus or other incentives under this section if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a residential development project for which a density bonus or other incentives were previously granted under this chapter. 17.107.080 Density Incentives. A density incentive is a benefit granted by the City that results in identifiable and actual cost reductions necessary to provide for the reduced rents or sales prices for the target living units, and shall mean any of the following: A. The reduction in development standards that exceed the

--- Chunk 1171 ---
minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including but not limited to: 1. Required off-street parking; 2. Required setbacks; 3. Maximum building height and/or stories; 4. Required open space; 5. Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR); 6. Minimum lot area; 7. Minimum courtyards. B. Approval of a mix of allowed uses in conjunction with the residential housing development if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development, and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the residential housing development and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed residential housing development will be located. C. Other regulatory incentives proposed by the developer, or the City, that would result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable rent or affordable housing cost, as demonstrated by the developer., but which shall not include any proposals for modification to the City’s uniformly applied development standards imposed as Standard Conditions of Approval. --- Page 688 --- OAKLAND 688 17.107.090 Permitted Number of Density Incentives. A. Number of Incentives. Except as otherwise provided

--- Chunk 1172 ---
by Section 17.107.100, when a developer proposes to construct a residential housing development that conforms to the requirements of Section 17.107.040, the developer shall receive the following number of incentives: 1. One (1) incentive for projects that include at least ten percent (10%) of the total units for low income households, at least five percent (5%) for very low income households, at least ten percent (10%) for persons and families of moderate income, or at least twenty percent (20%) of the total units for lower income students in a student housing development. 2. Two (2) incentives for projects that include at least twenty percent (20%) of the total units for lower income households, at least ten percent (10%) for very low income households, or at least twenty percent (20%) for persons and families of moderate income. 3. Three (3) incentives for projects that include at least thirty percent (30%) of the total units for lower income households, at least fifty percent (15%) for very low income households, or at least thirty percent (30%) for persons and families of moderate income. 4. Four (4) incentives for projects that meet the criteria of Category 7 in subsection A of Section 17.107.040. 17.107.095

--- Chunk 1173 ---
Waiver of Development Standards. A. Per California Government Code 65915(e)(1), in no case may a city apply any development standard that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the category criteria in Subsection 17.107.040.A. at the densities or with the incentives permitted by this Chapter. B. A developer may submit a proposal for the waiver or reduction of any development standard that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the category criteria in Subsection 17.107.040.A. at the densities, or with the incentives permitted, under this Chapter. The developer must include in their proposal an explanation of how that development standard has the effect of physically precluding the construction of the development, including schematics or drawings that illustrate the impact of the development standard taking into consideration the incentives already requested. Where more than one waiver is sought, the developer must clearly demonstrate why the waivers are cumulatively necessary to prevent a development standard from physically precluding the construction of the development. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards if the Director of Planning determines that the waiver or

--- Chunk 1174 ---
reduction does not physically preclude the construction of the development or results in any of the following: 1. A specific, adverse impact, as defined in Paragraph (2) of Subdivision (d) of California Government Code Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact; 2. An adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources; or 3. The waiver or reduction that would be contrary to State or Federal law. --- Page 689 --- OAKLAND 689 C. The granting of a waiver shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval. A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce, nor increase, the number of incentives to which the developer is entitled. 17.107.100 Findings for denial of Incentives. A developer seeking a density bonus may submit to the City a proposal for the specific incentives that the developer requests; the City shall grant the incentive requested by the developer, unless the City makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence

--- Chunk 1175 ---
of any of the following: A. The incentive does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for the reduced rents or sales prices for the target living units. B. The incentive would have a specific adverse impact (as defined in Section 65589.5(d)(2) of the California Government Code), upon public health and safety or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households. C. The incentive would be contrary to State or Federal law. 17.107.105 Quality of target living units. A. The floor area, number of bedrooms, and amenities (such as bathrooms, fixtures, appliances, location, and utilities) of the targeted living units shall be substantially equal in size and quality to those of the market-rate units. B. Tenant households in the targeted living units shall have the same level of access to the residential housing development’s services and facilities as tenant households in the market-rate units of the residential housing development. C. The targeted living units shall be evenly distributed throughout the residential housing development.

--- Chunk 1176 ---
D. The targeted living units shall be constructed concurrent with or prior to the construction of market-rate units in each phase of the residential housing development. The City shall not issue final certificates of occupancy for more than fifty percent (50%) of the market- rate units in any phase of development until final certificates of occupancy are issued for all of the targeted living units in that phase of development. 17.107.110 Continued affordability requirements. A. Where a developer proposes to provide target living units as rental units, all approvals for any affordable housing applications that include a density bonus and/or density incentive(s) shall be conditioned to ensure the continued affordability of the target living units that are part of the approvals for a period of not less than fifty-five (55) years, or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program, and their occupancy shall be restricted only to residents who satisfy the affordability requirements for the target living units. Prior to submittal of a construction-related permit, the developer shall enter into a regulatory agreement with the City, the terms of which shall be consistent with the

--- Chunk 1177 ---
--- Page 690 --- OAKLAND 690 City’s model documents, as may be amended from time to time, and shall be reviewed and revised as appropriate by the Housing and Community Development Department (Housing Development Services Division). The regulatory agreement shall contain restrictive covenants to ensure the continued affordability of rental target dwelling units at the specified rent level for a period of not less than fifty-five (55) years and shall restrict the occupancy of those units only to residents who satisfy eligibility standards and the affordability requirements as approved for the approved residential housing development. The regulatory agreement shall be recorded with the Alameda County Recorder’s Office as an encumbrance against the property, and a copy of the recorded agreement shall be provided to and retained by the City. The regulatory agreement shall not be subordinated in priority to any other lien interest in the property. B. Where a developer proposes to provide target living units as ownership units, all approvals for any affordable housing applications that include a density bonus and/or incentive(s) shall be conditioned to ensure that the restricted target living units comply with the City of Oakland Affordable Homeownership Development Program Guidelines. Developer shall pay a one-time

--- Chunk 1178 ---
fee to determine the eligibility of each initial homebuyer. The developer shall provide for initial homebuyer education to apprise buyers of the long-term affordability restrictions applicable to the targeted dwelling units, and shall submit information regarding the initial homebuyer’s income, household size, and other funding sources to the City of Oakland Housing and Community Development Department for review and approval. If a potential initial homebuyer does not meet the City of Oakland’s underwriting requirements, then the proposed homebuyer will not be allowed to purchase the home, and the developer will be required to find a qualified substitute buyer. The developer shall also be required to submit to the City evidence that all initial homebuyers of for-sale target dwelling units have entered into a density bonus equity share agreement prior to purchasing the unit or property, and the grant deed conveying title to the unit to the initial homebuyer shall reference the equity share agreement. Prior to submittal of a construction-related permit, the developer shall enter into an affordability agreement with the City, the terms of which shall be consistent with the City’s model documents, as may be amended from time to time, and shall be reviewed and revised as appropriate

--- Chunk 1179 ---
by the Housing and Community Development Department (Housing Development Services Division). The affordability agreement shall contain restrictive covenants to provide that target living units are offered at an affordable housing cost and that only households that meet the eligibility standards for the target living units and agree to execute an equity share agreement with the City are eligible to occupy the target living units. The affordability agreement shall be recorded with the Alameda County Recorder’s Office as an encumbrance against the property, and a copy of the recorded agreement shall be provided to and retained by the City. The affordability agreement shall not be subordinated in priority to any other lien interest in the property. C. The regulatory agreement or affordability agreement, as applicable, shall include at a minimum all of the following: 1. The total number of dwelling units approved for the residential housing development; 2. The total number of target living units approved for the residential housing development; 3. A description of the household income group to be accommodated by the restricted affordable units and the standard for determining the corresponding affordable rent or affordable housing cost; --- Page 691 --- OAKLAND 691 D. If the site proposed

--- Chunk 1180 ---
for the residential housing development has an approved condominium map and the developer chooses to rent the target living units at initial occupancy, the target living units cannot convert to ownership during the term of the regulatory agreement, even if the market-rate units in the residential housing development convert to ownership. 17.107.111 Eligibility requirements. Only those households meeting the standards for very low income, low income, moderate income or other category listed in Section 17.107.040, as applicable to the proposed residential housing development, shall be eligible to occupy target living units. 17.107.112 Density bonus equity share agreement. All buyers of for-sale target living units shall enter into a density bonus equity share agreement with the City prior to purchasing the unit or property. The equity share agreement shall specify that the title to the subject property or unit may not be transferred without prior approval of the City. The owner of the for-sale target living unit may not rent out the unit, and the unit must remain owner occupied. Following City approval, the developer shall record the equity share agreement against the parcel containing the target dwelling unit, as well as a Deed of Trust and Request for Notice in

--- Chunk 1181 ---
the event of default, sale, or refinancing, with the Alameda County Recorder’s Office, and shall provide a copy of the recorded equity share agreement to the City. 17.107.113 Management and monitoring. Rental target living units shall be managed/operated by the developer or developer’s agent or successor. Each developer of rental target living units shall submit for review and approval by the Housing and Community Development Department and any other relevant City departments an annual report to the City identifying which units are target living units, the monthly rent, vacancy information, monthly income for tenants of each target rental living unit throughout the prior year, and other information required by the City, while ensuring the privacy of the tenant. 17.107.114 Administrative fee for target living units. The developer shall pay to the Housing and Community Development Department an annual monitoring fee pursuant to the Master Fee Schedule, as updated annually, for City monitoring of rental target living units. The first payment of the monitoring fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of building permit(s). 17.107.115 City’s right to deny a project. Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the City's right to deny an affordable housing or senior citizen housing project

--- Chunk 1182 ---
if, based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record, the decision-making body can make any one of the findings set forth in Government Code Section 65589.5(d) presented below: 1. The jurisdiction has adopted a housing element pursuant to this article that has been revised in accordance with Section 65588, is in substantial compliance with this article, and the jurisdiction has met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need --- Page 692 --- OAKLAND 692 allocation pursuant to Section 65584 for the planning period for the income category proposed for the housing development project, provided that any disapproval or conditional approval shall not be based on any of the reasons prohibited by Section 65008. If the housing development project includes a mix of income categories, and the jurisdiction has not met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need for one or more of those categories, then this paragraph shall not be used to disapprove or conditionally approve the project. The share of the regional housing need met by the jurisdiction shall be calculated consistently with the forms and definitions that may be adopted by the Department of Housing and Community Development pursuant to Section 65400.

--- Chunk 1183 ---
In the case of an emergency shelter, the jurisdiction shall have met or exceeded the need for emergency shelter, as identified pursuant to Paragraph (7) of Subdivision (a) of Section 65583. Any disapproval or conditional approval pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with applicable law, rule, or standards. 2. The housing development project or emergency shelter as proposed would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible. As used in this paragraph, a "specific, adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. Inconsistency with the Oakland Planning Code or General Plan land use designation shall not constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. 3. The denial of the housing development project or imposition of conditions is required in order to comply with specific State or Federal law, and there is

--- Chunk 1184 ---
no feasible method to comply without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate- income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible. 4. The housing development project or emergency shelter is proposed on land zoned for agriculture or resource preservation that is surrounded on at least two (2) sides by land being used for agricultural or resource preservation purposes, or which does not have adequate water or wastewater facilities to serve the project. 5. The housing development project or emergency shelter is inconsistent with both the Oakland Planning Code and General Plan land use designation as specified in any element of the General Plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial compliance with this article. 17.107.120 Parking ratio reductions mandated by California Government Code A. Per California Government Code, upon the request of the developer, the City shall not require a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of parking for persons with disability and guests, of a residential housing development meeting the category criteria in Subsection 17.107.040.A. that exceeds the following ratios: 1. Zero (0) to

If a residential housing development includes at least forty percent (40%) moderate income units, at least twenty percent (20%) low-income units, or at least eleven percent (11%) very low income units, and is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, and there is unobstructed access to the major transit stop from the residential housing development, then, upon the request of the developer, the City shall not impose a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of parking for persons with disability and guests, that exceeds 0.5 spaces per unit. C. If a residential housing development consists solely of rental units, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, with an affordable rent to lower income families, then, upon the request of the developer, the City shall not impose a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of parking for persons with disability and guests, that exceeds the following ratio: 1. If the residential housing development is located within one-half mile of a

--- Chunk 1186 ---
major transit stop, and there is unobstructed access to the major transit stop from the development, the City shall not impose vehicular parking standards. 2. If the development is a for-rent housing development for individuals who are 62 years of age or older that complies with Sections 51.2 and 51.3 of the Civil Code and has either paratransit service or unobstructed access, within one-half mile, to fixed bus route service that operates at least eight times per day, the City shall not impose vehicular parking standards. 3. If the development is a special needs housing development, as defined in Section 51312 of the California Health and Safety Code, or a supportive housing development, as defined in Section 50675.14 of the California Health and Safety Code, the City shall not impose vehicular parking standards. A development that is a special needs housing development shall have either paratransit service or unobstructed access, within one-half mile, to fixed bus route service that operates at least eight times per day. D. If the total number of parking spaces required for a residential housing development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of

--- Chunk 1187 ---
this section, a development may provide "onsite parking" through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on street parking. E. This provision shall apply to a development that meets the requirements of Section 17.107.040, but only at the request of the developer. A developer may request parking incentives beyond those provided in Section 17.107.120, pursuant to Section 17.107.080. A request pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives to which the developer is entitled. --- Page 694 --- OAKLAND 694 Chapter 17.108 GENERAL HEIGHT, YARD, AND COURT REGULATIONS Sections: 17.108.010 Height restrictions on lots abutting property in an RH, RD, or RM Zone. 17.108.020 Different maximum height in certain situations. 17.108.030 Allowed projections above height limits. 17.108.040 Reserved. 17.108.050, 17.108.060 Reserved. 17.108.070 Reserved. 17.108.080 Minimum side yard opposite living room windows. 17.108.090—17.108.110 Reserved. 17.108.120 Minimum court between opposite walls on same lot. 17.108.130 Exceptions to required openness of minimum yards and courts. 17.108.140 Fences, dense hedges, barriers, and similar freestanding walls. 17.108.150 Retaining walls. 17.108.010 Height restrictions on lots abutting property in an RH, RD, or RM Zone.

allowed by Section 17.108.030. A. General Height Provisions for Volumetric Modular Projects. Volumetric modular construction is defined as construction that involves building six-sided modules constructed of floors, walls, and ceiling off-site, designing to the same codes and standards as conventionally built structures, and then transporting the modules to the construction site for installation. The maximum allowed height of Residential and Nonresidential Facilities constructed using volumetric modular construction shall be increased above the height limit prescribed in the applicable individual zone regulations by one (1) foot for each building story. For example, if the individual zone regulations limit height to a maximum of sixty (60) feet, eligible facilities with six (6) stories would be allowed a maximum height of sixty-six (66) feet. For facilities utilizing this provision, prior to the issuance of building permits the proposed volumetric modular construction methods must be confirmed to implement the height increase. If modular methods are not confirmed, the project shall be built according to the applicable individual zone height regulations. (Ord. No. 13168, § 5(Exh. A-2), 6-18-2013; Ord. No. 13112, § 4(Exh.

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Nonconforming Use Regulations. The purpose of these regulations is to control, ameliorate, or terminate uses which do not conform to the zoning regulations. These regulations shall apply to all nonconforming uses. (Prior planning code § 7400) 17.114.020 Definitions. As used in this Chapter: "Alteration" means an enlargement; addition; demolition; removal; relocation; repair; remodeling; change in number of living units; development of or change in an open area; development of or change in a Sign, by painting or otherwise; or any other change in a facility, but excluding painting except as provided above for Signs, and ordinary maintenance for which no building permit is required. "Nonconforming activity" means an activity which, under the zoning regulations, is not itself a permitted activity where it is located or does not conform to the off-street parking or loading requirements, performance standards, or other requirements applying to activities. However, an activity of the character described above shall not be deemed a nonconforming activity

--- Chunk 1239 ---
to the extent that it has been or is hereafter authorized by a subsisting conditional use permit, variance, or other special zoning approval. "Nonconforming facility" means a facility which, under the zoning regulations, is not itself a permitted facility where it is located or does not conform to the density, Floor-Area Ratio (FAR), height, yard, court, buffering, landscaping or screening, or usable open space requirements; limitations on Signs; or other requirements applying to facilities. However, a facility of the character described above shall not be deemed a nonconforming facility to the extent that it has been or is hereafter authorized by a subsisting conditional use permit, variance, or other special zoning approval. --- Page 720 --- OAKLAND 720 "Nonconforming use" means a nonconforming activity or a nonconforming facility. "Substitution of activities" means the replacement of an existing activity by a new activity, or a change in the nature of an existing activity.

A), 3-16-2010; Prior planning code § 7401) 17.114.030 Effect of prior permits. A. Fundamental Vested Rights Not Abrogated By Code

--- Chunk 1240 ---
Adoption or Amendment. The adoption of, or amendment to, the Planning Code (Chapter 17), including without limitation, ordinances enacted pursuant to Oakland City Charter Section 213 (Emergency Ordinances) and/or ordinances enacted pursuant Government Code Section 65858 (Urgency Measure/moratoria), shall not abrogate any fundamental vested rights established pursuant to State law, including, without limitation, those established pursuant to the prior valid adoption and execution of a development agreement under Section 17.138.015 and the development agreement procedure in Chapter 17.138. Absent the prior establishment of such vested rights, any Planning Code adoption or amendment shall apply. B. Alcoholic Beverage Control Licenses. On premises for which a valid State of California Alcoholic Beverage Control license had been issued, and which premises had been used in the exercise of the rights and privileges conferred by the license at a time immediately prior to the effective date of the applicable provisions of Section 17.103.030, the premises may hereafter be used in the exercise of the same rights and privileges without requiring a conditional use permit or having to meet the provisions of the aforesaid section. The uses as they result that do not conform to the zoning regulations shall be deemed a nonconforming use and

--- Chunk 1241 ---
subject to the nonconforming use regulations, except as otherwise provided in Sections 17.114.020 and 17.114.030. For the purposes of this Subsection, the word "premises" shall mean and include only the actual space within a building devoted to the sale of alcoholic beverages on said effective date. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Prior planning code § 7402) 17.114.040 Right to continue nonconforming use, subject to limitations. A. Right to Continue. A nonconforming use which is in existence on the effective date of the zoning regulations or of any subsequent rezoning or other amendment thereto which makes such use nonconforming, and which existed lawfully under the previous zoning controls, or which is subsequently developed or changed pursuant to Section 17.114.030, may thereafter be continued and maintained indefinitely, and the rights to such use shall run with the land, except as otherwise specified in the nonconforming use regulations. However, no substitution, extension, or other change in activities and no alteration or other change in facilities is permitted except as otherwise provided in Section 17.114.030 and except as specifically provided hereinafter. B. Limitation on Right to Continue Nonconforming Auto and Truck-Related Activities in All Districts. As used in regards to all such

--- Chunk 1242 ---
nonconforming Auto and Truck-Related Activities, the word "activity" refers solely to the unique function or operation occurring on the affected property, and does not refer to any other activity within an activity type with which that activity is grouped. Any right to substitute, extend or alter an existing auto or truck-related activity refers solely to the specific existing function or operation, and does not provide any right to --- Page 721 --- OAKLAND 721 substitute, extend or alter that activity with any other type of activity within the activity type with which the activity is grouped.

B. Whenever a nonconforming Alcoholic Beverage Sales Commercial Activity discontinues active operation for more than ninety (90) days or ceases to be licensed

--- Chunk 1244 ---
by the State Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, it may only be resumed upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134. However, if another activity has replaced it, the former activity may thereafter be resumed if and only if such resumption would constitute an allowable change under Subsection 17.114.070.A. Section 17.114.060 shall also apply. C. Whenever a nonconforming Automotive Servicing or Automotive Repair and Cleaning Activity in the D-BV Zones discontinues active operation for more than six (6) months, it may only be resumed upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit --- Page 722 --- OAKLAND 722 procedure in Chapter 17.134.

Whenever a nonconforming Truck-Intensive Industrial Activities as defined in Section 17.103.065, Trucking and Truck-Related Industrial Activity, or Recycling and Waste-Related Industrial Activity in the M-40, CIX, IG, IO, D-CE-5, D-CE-6, D-CO-5, and D-CO-6 Zones discontinues active operation for more than zero (0) days, based on purposeful abandonment, the

--- Chunk 1245 ---
right to continue the nonconforming use shall expire immediately upon discontinuance of use. However, if another activity has replaced it, the former activity may thereafter only be resumed if and only if such resumption would constitute an allowable change under Subsection 17.114.070.A. Section 17.114.060 shall also apply. E. Activity Nonconforming for Other Reasons. A nonconforming activity which is itself a permitted activity where it is located, and which is nonconforming only as to applicable off- street parking or loading requirements, performance standards, or other requirements applying to activities, may be resumed regardless of the period during which it may have discontinued active operation. However, if another activity has replaced it, the former activity may thereafter be resumed only if such resumption would constitute an allowable change under Section 17.114.070B. Section 17.114.060 shall also apply. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 12999, § 4(Exh. A), 3-16-2010; Ord. No. 12939, § 4(Exh. A), 6-16-2009; Ord. 12899 § 4, Exh.

Facilities accommodating or serving a nonconforming Nonresidential Activity which are damaged or destroyed to the extent of not

--- Chunk 1246 ---
more than seventy-five percent (75%) may be restored to their prior condition and occupancy. If such damage or destruction exceeds seventy-five percent (75%), the facilities may thereafter only be restored to accommodate or serve the prior nonconforming activity upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134. B. Nonconforming Residential Activities. Facilities accommodating or serving a nonconforming Residential Activity which are damaged or destroyed to the extent of not more than seventy-five percent (75%) may be restored to their prior condition and occupancy. If such damage or destruction exceeds seventy-five percent (75%), the facilities may thereafter only be restored to accommodate or serve the prior nonconforming Residential Activity provided all of the following conditions are met: 1. That documentation is provided which substantiates that such damage or destruction occurred involuntarily with respect to the owner of said facility or unit(s); 2. That no expansion in the number of living units occurs; 3. That plans for the proposal are approved pursuant to the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136; and 4. That a building permit is sought and obtained no later than three (3) years after the date of the facility's damage

Any Commercial Activity permitted in the CC-2 Zone. Changes

--- Chunk 1250 ---
that do not constitute substitutions may be made in any activity which is nonconforming wholly or partly because it is not itself a permitted activity where it is located. The above substitutions and other changes may be made without regard for requirements on off-street parking and loading, conduct of activities within enclosed buildings, means of customer access, and total floor area which normally apply to activities, except as otherwise provided in Section 17.116.020C. However: 1. If the nonconforming activity is itself conditionally permitted where it is located, no substitution or other change shall be made in it which would conflict with, or further conflict with, any requirement on off-street parking or loading, conduct of activities within enclosed buildings, means of customer access, or total floor area which normally applies to activities. (Changes which are allowed by Section 17.116.020B shall not be deemed to conflict or further conflict with the parking or loading requirements). 2. Conversions of dwelling units to use by a Nonresidential Activity shall be subject, where applicable, to the provisions of Section 17.102.230 3. If the nonconforming activity is located at ground level on any lot in the CN-1 or CN-2 Zone, no change shall be made in

--- Chunk 1251 ---
the nature of the particular activity, except when the result is itself permitted in the same location, unless a Conditional Use Permit is granted pursuant to the Conditional Use Permit procedure. This does not restrict a change in ownership, tenancy, or management where the previous line of business or other function is not changed. 4. For any nonconforming Alcoholic Beverage Sales Commercial Activity presently located in any zone in which it is not a permitted activity, no change shall be made in the activity which change requires obtaining a different type of alcoholic beverage sale retail license from the state of California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. --- Page 726 --- OAKLAND 726 5. No substitution or other change shall be made in any nonconforming activity which would conflict, or further conflict, with any applicable provision of the performance standards in Chapter 17.120, or of any kind of requirement not mentioned hereinabove which applies to activities. 6. In cases of discontinuance, damage, or destruction, the pertinent provisions of Sections 17.114.050 or 17.114.060 shall also apply. If the activity resulting from a change allowed above is not a normally permitted and otherwise conforming activity, and is not authorized by a Conditional

--- Chunk 1252 ---
Use Permit or other special zoning approval, it shall be deemed a nonconforming activity and changes in it shall be subject to this Section. B. Activity Nonconforming for Other Reasons. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 17.114.050 and 17.114.060, an activity which is itself permitted or, upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure, an activity which is itself conditionally permitted may be substituted for any activity which is itself a permitted activity where it is located and which is nonconforming only as to applicable off-street parking or loading requirements, performance standards, or other requirements applying to activities. Changes other than substitutions may also be made in such activities. However, no substitution or other change shall be made which would create any new nonconformity, or increase any existing nonconforming, with respect to said requirements. (Changes which are allowed by Section 17.116.020.B shall not be deemed to conflict or further conflict with the parking or loading requirements.) If the activity resulting from the change does not meet such requirements, and is not authorized by a conditional use permit or other special zoning approval, it shall be deemed nonconforming and changes in it shall be

--- Chunk 1253 ---
subject to this Subsection. (Ord. No. 1 , § _(Exh. _), 4-2-2019; Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. No. 12999, § 4(Exh. A), 3-16-2010; Ord.

Nonresidential Activity Nonconforming Because It Is Not a Permitted Activity. Except as otherwise provided in Section 17.114.060, a Nonresidential Activity which is nonconforming wholly or partly because it is not itself a permitted activity where it is located may be extended, and the facilities accommodating or serving such activity may be altered or otherwise changed, subject to the requirements normally applying to uses where the activity is located and subject to the following provisions and exceptions: 1. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (A)(3) of this Section, the floor area and overall outside dimensions of any building, or portion thereof, devoted to such activity shall not be increased; no open parking, loading, sales, display, service, production, or storage area accommodating or serving such activity shall be relocated or

--- Chunk 1254 ---
increased in size; and no such building or open area shall be wholly reconstructed. However, in the case of an establishment classified as an Alcoholic Beverage Sales Commercial Activity, the total floor area, open areas, or outside building dimensions occupied by the establishment may be increased as long as the amount of space actually devoted to the sale of alcoholic beverages is not increased by more than twenty percent (20%) of that already existing. See Tables 17.15.01 (L4), 17.17.01 (L4), and 17.19.01 (L7) for restrictions to this allowable expansion in the RD, RM, and RU Zones. --- Page 727 --- OAKLAND 727 2. In the case of an establishment classified as an Alcoholic Beverage Sales Commercial Activity, the percentage of actual floor area devoted to the sale of alcoholic beverages shall not be increased by more than twenty percent (20%) of that already existing, except upon the granting of a conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134. 3. New, wholly reconstructed, enlarged, or relocated structures or open areas devoted to off-street parking or loading serving such activity may be provided wherever Automotive Fee Parking Commercial Activities are permitted or, upon the granting of a

--- Chunk 1255 ---
conditional use permit pursuant to the conditional use permit procedure in Chapter 17.134, wherever Automotive Fee Parking Commercial Activities are conditionally permitted. In Residential Zones, such facilities for off-street parking may be provided in the situations, and subject to the conditions, prescribed in Section 17.116.075. 4. New Signs may be provided for such activity, but the aggregate area of display surface of all Signs serving such activity shall not be increased. All Signs shall be subject to the limitations, other than aggregate area of display surface, normally applying to Signs where they are located. 5. During any five-year period, beginning on or after the effective date of the zoning regulations or of any subsequent rezoning or other amendment thereto which makes such activity thus nonconforming, the aggregate cost of all alterations for which a building or sign permit is required, and which are intended for any activity subject to this Subsection, shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the replacement cost, as estimated by the Building Services Department, of the facilities accommodating or serving such activity at the beginning of said period. However, the cost of alterations ordered by any governmental agency or permitted by Section 17.114.060 shall be exempt

--- Chunk 1256 ---
from said maximum cost. 6. No facility accommodating a nonconforming Automobile and Other Light Vehicle Gas Station and Servicing or Automotive and Other Light Vehicle Repair and Cleaning Commercial Activity shall be altered in exterior appearance, unless plans for the proposal have been approved pursuant to the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136. 7. A nonconforming Automobile and Other Light Vehicle Gas Station and Servicing or Automotive and Other Light Vehicle Repair and Cleaning Commercial Activity in the HBX-1 Zone may be extended, and the facilities accommodating or serving such activity may be altered or otherwise changed upon the granting of a conditional use permit (see Chapter 17.134) and approval pursuant to the Regular design review procedure in Chapter 17.136. This conditional use permit and design review approval may be granted only upon determination that the proposal is adequately buffered from the street and surrounding Residential Activities through landscaping and fencing. B. Residential Activity Nonconforming Because It Is Not a Permitted Activity. Except as otherwise provided in Section 17.114.060, a Residential Activity which is nonconforming wholly or partly because it is not itself a permitted activity where it is located may be extended, and the facilities accommodating or serving such

--- Chunk 1257 ---
activity may be altered or otherwise changed, subject to the following provisions: 1. The number of living units shall not be increased. 2. The amount of added or wholly reconstructed floor area devoted to such activity shall not exceed in the aggregate twenty percent (20%) of that already existing on the affected lot. If a new or wholly reconstructed floor area is developed, usable open space shall be provided for all living units on the lot in the amount required in the RU-2 Zone. --- Page 728 --- OAKLAND 728 3. Existing usable open space shall not be reduced below, or if already less than shall not be reduced further below, the usable open space requirements applying in the RU-2 Zone. 4. All alterations and other changes shall conform to, or not further conflict with, the minimum yard and court and maximum height requirements and the limitations on Signs generally applying in the RM-3 Zone, as well as to the requirements generally applying to uses where the activity is actually located. C. Activity Nonconforming for Other Reasons. Except as otherwise provided in Section 17.114.060, any activity which is itself a permitted activity where it is located and which is nonconforming

--- Chunk 1258 ---
only as to off-street parking or loading requirements, performance standards, or other requirements applying to activities may be extended, and the facilities accommodating or serving such activity may be altered or otherwise changed, in any way which does not result in a greater degree of nonconformity with respect to such requirements and which conforms to the requirements normally applying to uses where the activity is located.

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Off-street Parking and Loading Requirements. The purpose of these regulations is to require adequate off-street parking and loading, thereby reducing traffic congestion, allowing more efficient utilization of on-street parking, promoting more efficient loading operations, and reducing the use of public streets for loading purposes. Except as may otherwise be specified in Chapter 17.101E for the D-CE Zones, these requirements shall apply to the indicated activities as specified hereinafter. See Chapter 17.101E Central Estuary District Zones Regulations for parking regulations specific to Boat and Marine- Related Sales, Rental, Repair and Servicing for the D-CE Central Estuary District Zones. (Ord. No. 13168, § 5(Exh. A-2), 6-18-2013; Prior planning code § 7500) 17.116.020 Effect on new and existing uses. A. New Parking and Loading to Be Provided for New Facilities and Additions to Existing Facilities. The off-street parking and loading requirements of this Chapter shall only apply to activities occupying any portion of

--- Chunk 1269 ---
new facilities and new additions to existing facilities. The required amount of new parking and loading shall be based on the cumulative increase in floor area, or other applicable unit of measurement, and any minimum size for which parking or loading is required in Articles II and IV of this Chapter. B. Changes in Activity within an Existing Facility. No additional parking and loading spaces are required for a change of activity within an existing facility. However, if the number of existing parking spaces on the lot equals or is less than required, then these parking spaces must be preserved with the change of activity. If there are more parking spaces on the lot than required, then the number of spaces can be reduced to the minimum required. --- Page 734 --- OAKLAND 734 C. New Living Units in Existing Facilities. Except as provided for Accessory Dwelling Units in Section 17.103.080 and Chapter 17.88, no additional parking and loading spaces are required for newly established living units located entirely within an existing facility and outside of the S-9 Fire Safety Protection Combining Zone. However, if the number of existing parking spaces on the lot equals or is less than required,

--- Chunk 1270 ---
then these parking spaces must be preserved with the establishment of new living units. If there are more parking spaces on the lot than required, then the number of spaces can be reduced to the minimum required. D. Existing Required Parking and Loading to Be Maintained. Existing parking or loading that is equal to or less than the minimum required shall not be reduced in amount unless equivalent substitute facilities are provided. These substitute facilities must be consistent with the standards and requirements described in this Chapter. E. Parking to be Provided for Existing Residential Facilities. When a conditional use permit is required by Section 17.102.300 for the alteration of, or addition to, an existing Residential Facility in order to create a total of five (5) or more bedrooms in any dwelling unit, the off-street parking requirement of Section 17.102.300.C shall apply to the entire facility, including the existing facility and any alteration or addition. 17.116.030 More than one activity on a lot. Whenever a single lot contains different activities with the same off-street parking or loading requirement, the overall requirement shall be based on the sum of all such activities, and the minimum size prescribed hereafter for which any

--- Chunk 1271 ---
parking or loading is required shall be deemed to be exceeded for all such activities if it is exceeded by their sum. Whenever a single lot contains activities with different off-street parking or loading requirements, the overall requirement shall be the sum of the requirements for each such activity calculated separately; provided, however, that the minimum size prescribed hereafter for which any parking is required shall be deemed to be exceeded on said lot for all activities for which the same or a smaller minimum size, expressed in the same unit of measurement, is prescribed, if said minimum size is exceeded by the sum of all such activities on the lot. (Prior planning code § 7503) 17.116.040 Determination by Director of City Planning. In the case of activities for which the Director of City Planning is required to prescribe a number of parking spaces or loading berths, he or she shall base his or her determination on the traffic generation of the activities, the amount and frequency of loading operations thereof, the time of operation of the activities, their location, and such other factors as affect the need for off- street parking or loading. At his or her discretion, the

--- Chunk 1272 ---
Director of City Planning may require the applicant to provide an analysis of parking demand and capacity from an independent professional. Any such determination shall be subject to appeal pursuant to the administrative appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. 17.116.050 Calculation rules. If after calculating the number of required off-street parking spaces a quotient is obtained containing a fraction of one-half or more, an additional space shall be required; if such fraction is less than one-half it may be disregarded. When the parking requirement is based on number of employees, the number of spaces shall be based on the number of working persons typically --- Page 735 --- OAKLAND 735 engaging in the specified activity on the lot during the largest shift of the peak season. When the requirement is based on number of doctors, the number of spaces shall be based on the number of such doctors typically engaging in the activity on the lot during the peak daily period. When the requirement is based on number of seats, each twenty (20) inches of pews or similar facilities shall be counted as one seat.

Reduction of Total Requirements with Shared Parking Area. For a joint off-street parking area that serves more than one activity (either on the

--- Chunk 1292 ---
same or different lots) and meets the conditions set forth in Section 17.116.180, the total parking requirement for the sharing activities shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) upon the submittal of evidence sufficient to determine that the typical utilization of the parking area would be staggered to such an extent that the reduced number of spaces would be adequate to serve all such activities. E. Discretionary Waiver or Reduction in Districts Providing Common Parking Areas. The off-street parking requirements specified above for Nonresidential Activities in any zone, or for Residential Activities in Commercial Zones, may be waived or reduced by the Director of City Planning when said activities are located within a municipal parking district or assessment district the function of which is to provide off-street parking, upon a finding that, in consideration of existing or prospective municipal parking facilities, such waiver or reduction would not substantially contribute to traffic congestion or impair the efficiency of on- street parking. Any determination on such waiver or reduction shall be subject to appeal pursuant to the administrative appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. F. Conversion of Historic Buildings. No additional parking spaces are required for any change of use of a facility

--- Chunk 1293 ---
that is listed in the City of Oakland’s Local Register of Historical --- Page 749 --- OAKLAND 749 Resources (see Policy 3.8 of Historic Preservation Element of the Oakland General Plan). If the number of existing parking spaces on the lot equals or is less than required, then these parking spaces must be preserved with the conversion. If there are more parking spaces on the lot than required, then the number of spaces can be reduced to the minimum required. G. Additions to Historic Buildings. No additional parking spaces are required for an addition that increases the floor area by one hundred percent (100%) or less of a facility that is listed in the City of Oakland’s Local Register of Historical Resources (see Policy 3.8 of Historic Preservation Element of the Oakland General Plan).

The parking in-lieu fee shall be as set forth in the Master Fee Schedule. Parking in-lieu fees shall be deposited with the City of Oakland prior to issuance of a building permit. A parking in-lieu fee may be refunded, without interest, to the person who made such payment, or his assignee or designee, if additional off-street parking spaces are provided for such building or use by others than the City so as to satisfy the parking requirement for which the in-lieu payment was made. To obtain a refund, the required off-street parking spaces must be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy and before funds are spent or committed by the City. 2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Planning Code, Variances may not be granted relating to: (a) a reduction and/or

--- Chunk 1295 ---
elimination of any required parking; or (b) a reduction and/or elimination of any parking spaces serving any activity, or if already less than currently required parking, shall not be reduced further below the requirements prescribed for such activity in this Chapter, as the granting of a Conditional Use Permit (see Chapter 17.134 for the CUP procedure) and payment of the in-lieu fee shall be the means of reducing or eliminating such parking, except as provisions in state and local law requiring regulatory concessions and waivers for certain types of affordable and senior housing projects may apply.

This Chapter establishes City of Oakland implementation of Article 2 of the Housing Crisis Act, California Government Code Section 66300.5 et sequitur. 17.122.020 - Definitions. For purposes of this Chapter only, the following definitions shall apply: “Developer.” Developer means the owner or owner’s authorized agent, or other person, including a lessee, having the right under the Oakland Zoning Regulations, to make an application for development. It shall also include any successor in interest thereto. “Demolition of Protected Units.”

--- Chunk 1365 ---
Demolition of Protected Units means any action that results in the elimination of, or reduction in the number of bedrooms in, one or more existing Protected Units, including but not limited to the razing, tearing down or wrecking of any facility, structure or building, the conversion of existing Protected Units into non-residential uses, the conversion of existing Protected Units into unprotected Dwelling Units, and subdivisions through existing structures that would place each existing Protected Unit on separate parcels. Notwithstanding the above, applications for condominium conversion in the City of Oakland shall be regulated pursuant to Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 16.36 in lieu of compliance with this Chapter. "Equivalent Size." Equivalent Size means that each Replacement Deed-Restricted Units contains at least the same number of bedrooms as the Dwelling Unit being Replaced. Replacement Deed-Restricted Units in newly constructed buildings must also contain at least ninety (90) percent of the square footage of the Dwelling Unit being Replaced. “Protected Unit.” Protected Unit means a Dwelling Unit, regardless of condition or zoning status, that meets any of the following: --- Page 788 --- OAKLAND 788 1. A rental Dwelling Unit that is currently subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts

--- Chunk 1366 ---
rents to levels affordable to Lower Income Households; is currently subject to any other form of rent or price control, including Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.010 et seq. and the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, as subsequently amended; or was subject to the above in the five-year period preceding the submittal of an application for development approvals, regardless of whether the unit has been vacated or demolished; 2. A rental Dwelling Unit that is occupied by a Lower Income Household or was occupied by a Lower Income Household in the five year-period preceding the submittal of an application for development approvals, regardless of whether the unit has been vacated or demolished; 3. A rental Dwelling Unit that has been withdrawn from rent or lease pursuant to the Ellis Act, Government Code Section 7060 et seq. in the ten-year period preceding the submittal of an application for development approvals. “Replacement Deed-Restricted Unit.” Replacement Deed-Restricted Unit means a dwelling unit that fulfills the obligation to Replace, as defined in Section 17.122.040, a Protected Unit. 17.122.030 – Applicability. A. The requirements of this Chapter shall apply to any development project that is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels

--- Chunk 1367 ---
on which a dwelling unit is located or was located in the ten years preceding application submittal. B. Notwithstanding the above, this Chapter shall not apply to a development project proposed on a property that includes a parcel or parcels on which a dwelling unit is located, or was located, in the ten years preceding application submittal only if all of the following conditions exist: 1. The development project proposes an Industrial Activity. 2. The property is entirely within a zone that does not allow Residential Activities. 3. The zoning applicable to the property that does not allow Residential Activities was adopted prior to January 1, 2022. 4. The dwelling units that are or were located on the property are not Work/Live units. 5. The dwelling units that are or were located on the property are or were unpermitted. C. A development project that is proposed to legalize unpermitted units that are subject to a code enforcement action may exceed the maximum allowable density of the applicable zoning designation but must still comply with this Chapter and Chapter 8.22, as applicable and are subject to the following: 1. All units that are in excess of the maximum allowable density, with

--- Chunk 1368 ---
exception of units received pursuant to the Density Bonus Ordinance (Chapter 17.107), shall be deed restricted and made available to low-income households for fifty-five (55) years or the life of the project, whichever is longer. 2. The previously unpermitted units shall remain rent controlled if the units were previously --- Page 789 --- OAKLAND 789 subject to rent control and the units shall be treated as Replacement Deed-Restricted Units if the project includes Demolition of Protected Units. The Developer shall comply with the Just Cause for Eviction Ordinance. 3. The project must comply with all code requirements, including but not limited to the requirement for a building permit and compliance with the Building Code, but may request a waiver of Planning Code development standards of the underlying zone if the standard would physically preclude the proposal to legalize the unpermitted unit. The City may deny the waiver request if the City makes a finding that denying the waiver is necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or occupants of the structure. 4. This right shall never be used more than one time per parcel. 5. Notwithstanding the above, this subsection C shall not preclude an applicant from

--- Chunk 1369 ---
applying for a Rezoning or Variance. D. Where a conflict exists between the requirements in this Chapter and the applicable requirements contained in California Government Code Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 12, Article 2 (Section 66300.5 et seq.), the applicable requirements of the Government Code shall prevail unless the requirements of this Chapter are more protective of Lower Income households or provide greater relocation assistance to displaced households. E. This Chapter does not confer additional legal protections upon an unlawful occupant of a Protected Unit. F. The right of first refusal described in Section 17.122.070 does not apply to an occupant of a short-term residential rental that is rented for a period of fewer than thirty (30) days. 17.122.035 – Restrictions. A. Demolition of dwelling units, whether or not Protected Units, shall be prohibited in the following circumstances: 1. The demolition is proposed in furtherance of a housing development project that creates fewer dwelling units than the greatest number of dwelling units that existed on the project site within the last five years. 2. There have been any adjudicated cases evidencing tenant harassment or illegal eviction during the application process prior to the issuance of the demolition or building permit

--- Chunk 1370 ---
or during the five-year period prior to application submittal. 3. A prior entitlement at the project site was denied or voided within the past five years based on documentation in the Unit Inventory, prepared pursuant to Section 17.122.060, that a unit became vacant by unlawful means. 17.122.040 – Replacement of Protected Units. A. The City shall not approve any demolition permit, building permit, or land use entitlement issued under these Zoning Regulations, including any change of use that requires a zoning clearance, for a development project that proposes the Demolition of Protected Units unless --- Page 790 --- OAKLAND 790 the development project Replaces all Protected Units, the Developer provides notice in compliance with Section 17.122.050, the Developer includes with their application a Unit Inventory in compliance with Section 17.122.060, the Developer commits to providing rights of first refusal to occupants of Protected Units in compliance with Section 17.122.070, and the proposal otherwise fully complies with this Chapter. B. For purposes of this Chapter only, “Replace” shall mean either of the following: 1. If any Protected Units have been occupied at any time during the five-year period preceding the date of application, the proposed development shall include residential uses that

--- Chunk 1371 ---
provide at least the same number of units as those demolished as part of the Demolition of Protected Units, of Equivalent Size, to be made available as Affordable Housing occupied by persons and families in the same or lower income category as those households currently or last in occupancy of the Protected Units. If the income category of the current or last household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed Lower Income Households occupied these units in the same proportion of Lower Income renter households to all renter households within the City of Oakland, as determined using the most recently available data for renter income distribution in the City of Oakland from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. 2. If all Protected Units have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the date of application, the proposed development shall include residential uses that provide at least the same number of Dwelling Units of Equivalent Size as existed at the highpoint of those Dwelling Units in the five-year period preceding the application to be made available as Affordable Housing occupied by persons and families in the same or

--- Chunk 1372 ---
lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that time. If the income category of the current or last household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed Low Income and Very Low Income Households occupied these units in the same proportion of Low Income and Very Low Income renter households to all renter households within the City of Oakland, as determined using the most recently available data for renter income distribution in the City of Oakland from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. 3. For any Protected Unit that is or was subject to any other form of rent or price control within the five-year period preceding the application and was last occupied by persons or families above lower income (or was presumed to be occupied by persons or families above lower income using the formulas provided in paragraphs 1 and 2), the Replacement Deed-Restricted Unit must be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, low-income persons or families. C. All Replacement Deed-Restricted Unit calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. D. Documentation

--- Chunk 1373 ---
of a legally binding commitment, recorded against the property, to construct Replacement Deed-Restricted Units in accordance with this Chapter shall be a required condition prior to issuance of any demolition, grading, or building permit. E. For any unit that the Developer proposes to Replace, the Developer shall comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 8.22, Residential Rent Adjustment and Evictions, including but not limited to, relocation assistance and registration and reporting obligations --- Page 791 --- OAKLAND 791 under Section 8.22.510. Where the provisions of State law provide the right to evict existing occupants, the Developer must comply with the following provisions: 1. If in any circumstances the Developer causes the existing occupants of any Protected Units that are Lower Income Households to relocate in a manner that does not obligate the Developer to provide relocation payments under Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 8.22 or Chapter 15.60, the Developer shall comply with any obligation as provided in California Government Code Section 66300.6, subsection (b)(4)(A) to provide relocation benefits equivalent to the relocation benefits required to be paid by public entities pursuant to California Government Code Title 1, Division 7, Chapter 16 (commencing with Section 7260). 2. A Developer shall comply with

--- Chunk 1374 ---
provisions of Government Code Section 66300.6, subsection (b)(3) to allow any existing occupant to occupy their units until six months or less before the start of construction activities; to provide notice at least six months in advance of the date that existing occupants must vacate; and to allow existing occupants who were required to leave to return to their unit at their prior rental rate if the demolition does not proceed and the property is returned to the rental market. This subsection does not serve to create a new just cause for eviction, does not waive the Developer’s obligation to comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 8.22, and does not compel an occupant to remain in the unit until six months before the start of construction activities. In any circumstances where the Developer provides such notice, the notice shall also state that the notice does not serve as an eviction notice. A Developer who enters into a Move Out Agreement consistent with Article VI of Chapter 8.22 with an occupant is not subject to this requirement since the occupant is not being compelled to move out. F. If the Developer is proposing a non-residential project, the Developer shall demonstrate

--- Chunk 1375 ---
that they have acquired sufficient Replacement Unit Rights as part of their development application. 1. “Replacement Unit Rights” are generated by a project which adds housing units to the City’s housing supply, and one (1) Replacement Unit Right is equivalent to one (1) housing unit within such a project. 2. Replacement Unit Rights may be generated by a separate project either undertaken by the Developer or undertaken by others from whom the Developer has obtained or acquired such “rights” in a legally binding manner by a recorded document to be approved by the City. 3. A project generating Replacement Unit Rights must be located within the City of Oakland. 4. Once the Replacement Deed-Restricted Units have been developed or secured, a regulatory agreement that restricts the appropriate number, size and affordability levels of Replacement Deed-Restricted Units must be approved by the City and recorded on the housing development prior to issuance of the first construction-related permit for the non-residential project. Where the project is changing the use from residential without associated construction, the regulatory agreement must be recorded before the City will issue the Planning approval for the change of use. At the time of issuance of the construction-related permit

--- Chunk 1376 ---
or change of use permit for the non-residential project, the replacement housing must be under construction or completed within the last twelve (12) months and the Developer must have (a) recorded the required regulatory agreement --- Page 792 --- OAKLAND 792 approved by the City and (b) provided a signed agreement that any existing occupants will be provided the right of first refusal in the new development in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter. 5. The Replacement Deed-Restricted Units provided through Replacement Unit Rights must otherwise meet the affordability and Equivalent Size requirements specified in this section and shall be subject to the right of first refusal provisions provided in Section 17.122.070. 6. No Replacement Unit Rights shall be generated by a project or specific parts of a project which: (a) are intended to become the property of the Oakland Housing Authority, (b) receive financial assistance from the City or the Oakland Redevelopment Successor Agency, or (c) are located on property that was purchased or leased from a public or quasi-public agency. 17.122.050 – Notice to Existing Occupants and Prospective Tenants. If any Protected Unit in a building subject to a proposal for the Demolition of Protected Units is

occupied thirty (30) days prior to the submittal of an application for development, the following requirements shall apply. If a rental agreement was negotiated in a language other than English, all required written notices referred to in this section must be issued in that language and in English. For each application, all documents referred to in this section shall be reviewed by the Planning and Building Department as to form, correctness, and completeness. The Planning and Building Department may create forms to assist Developers in providing these notices, in which case the Developer shall use the forms created. If the documents provided do not meet the requirements of this section, including if the documents were dated fewer than thirty (30) days ago, the Planning and Building Department shall ministerially reject the application without prejudice for the Developer to resubmit after adequate and compliant thirty- (30) day notice is provided. A. Preliminary Notice to Existing Occupants Prior to Filing an Application for Development.

It is not a notice that you must leave the building or that your tenancy is being ended.” 4. Notice of the fact that as part of the process to redevelop the property, the property owner may offer an incentive to the occupant to move, such as a monetary payment or --- Page 793 --- OAKLAND 793 alternative housing options, that the occupant is not required to agree to move, and that the City

--- Chunk 1379 ---
of Oakland has a Tenant Move Out Agreement Ordinance, with a link to that Ordinance (currently Article VI of Chapter 8.22 of the Oakland Municipal Code). 5.

Commencing at a date not less than thirty (30) days prior to the submittal of an application for development, the Developer shall give notice to each person applying after such date for rental of a Dwelling Unit in the building. This notice must be provided to the prospective tenant prior to the acceptance of any rent or deposit from the prospective tenant and prior to the execution of any rental agreement. The notice shall include the following: 1. Notice of the owner’s filing or plans to file an application to redevelop the property. 2. Information on how the existing unit proposed to be let to the prospective tenant will be affected by the development. 3. Notice of the fact that as part of the process to redevelop the property the property owner may offer an incentive to the tenant to move, such as a monetary payment or alternative housing options, that the prospective tenant is not required to agree to move, and that the City of Oakland has a Tenant

--- Chunk 1381 ---
Move Out Agreement Ordinance, with a link to that Ordinance (currently Article VI of Chapter 8.22 of the Oakland Municipal Code). 4. Information on the right of first refusal provisions under Section 17.122.070 including notice that the prospective tenant may be entitled to a right of first refusal; information on the income threshold for lower income households to qualify for the right of first refusal; a signature line for acknowledgement of the right of first refusal, a checkbox option for opting in to the right of first refusal, and contact information to be used for purposes of the right of first refusal. 5.

The Developer shall subsequently notify all persons who received notice under Subsections A and B above of the filing for an application for development within seven (7) days of the filing of the application for development. 17.122.060 – Unit Inventory. A. As part of the application submittal, the Developer shall submit a Unit Inventory that accounts for all Dwelling Units, including any unpermitted units, that are proposed to be affected by the proposal. For each affected Dwelling Unit in the building(s), the Unit Inventory must show compliance with the annual registration and reporting obligations under Section 8.22.510, if applicable, and must state the occupancy status as of the date of application, the name of the current or most recent occupants, the household size, the household income of the current or most recent occupants, or statement that such household income is not known and could not be determined after making good faith efforts to determine the household income, number of bedrooms and square footage of the unit, evidence of compliance with the

--- Chunk 1383 ---
noticing requirements described in Section 17.122.050, and information for each unit on whether the occupant is eligible for and has opted in to being contacted about the right of first refusal upon completion of the development. If the occupant is eligible and has opted in to being contacted, the Unit Inventory shall include the contact information provided by the occupant. 1. If a vacant Dwelling Unit has been occupied at any time during the five-year period preceding the submittal of the application, the Unit Inventory shall fully describe the lawful process and timeline by which the Dwelling Unit became vacant. If the Unit Inventory documents an unlawful process by which the unit became vacant during the five-year period, or the applicant fails to provide documentation listed under Section 17.122.060.E to show that all previously occupied units became vacant by lawful means, the permit application shall be denied. Notwithstanding the above, a Developer shall be excused of the requirement to document the process by which a unit became vacant if they establish, through evidence submitted with the Unit Inventory, that the Dwelling Unit at issue was vacant at the time that the Developer purchased the property and that they have undertaken

--- Chunk 1384 ---
good faith but unsuccessful efforts to gather information about the prior tenant from the previous owner. 2. If a Dwelling Unit is occupied, the Unit Inventory must include a statement acknowledging that the desire to redevelop the property is not a just cause for eviction of that Dwelling Unit under the City of Oakland Just Cause Ordinance and acknowledging that causing a unit to become vacant by unlawful means shall be a basis for voiding the entitlement and denial of the demolition permit, grading permit, and/or building permit. --- Page 795 --- OAKLAND 795 B. Prior to issuance of a demolition permit, grading permit, or building permit, the Developer shall prepare a first addendum to the Unit Inventory that reports on the status of each affected Dwelling Unit in the building(s). The first addendum shall list the last time each Dwelling Unit was occupied, and the monthly rental price last charged for the Dwelling Unit. For each Dwelling Unit previously reported in the Unit Inventory as occupied, the Developer shall provide substantial evidence and affirm that the Dwelling Unit is vacant in compliance with applicable laws, such as Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.300 et seq., Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.400

--- Chunk 1385 ---
et seq., and/or and state law. If the Unit Inventory documents that a unit has become vacant by unlawful means, or the applicant fails to provide documentation listed under Section 17.122.060.E to show that all previously occupied units became vacant by lawful means, the demolition permit, grading permit, and/or building permit shall be denied and the entitlement shall be voided. The entitlement shall include a condition of approval consistent with this paragraph. C. Prior to issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or certificate of occupancy, the Developer shall prepare a second addendum to the Unit Inventory that describes, for each qualifying prior occupant, compliance with the right of first refusal requirements, as applicable, as further described in Section 17.122.070. D. It shall be a violation of this Chapter to include false information on a submitted Unit Inventory or addenda thereto, subject to remedies provided under Section 17.122.080. Submittal of false information for each unit shall constitute a separate violation. E. In submitting Unit Inventories and addenda thereto, the Developer shall provide the following: 1. For each Dwelling Unit where Developer asserts the occupant vacated the Dwelling Unit pursuant to a valid termination notice that complies with the Oakland Just

--- Chunk 1386 ---
Cause for Eviction Ordinance, Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.300 et seq., documentation of all notices terminating tenancy and accompanying materials issued to the occupant. 2. For each Dwelling Unit where Developer asserts the occupant vacated the Dwelling Unit pursuant to a valid termination notice that complies with Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.400 et seq. (Ellis Act Ordinance), documentation of the notice to Rent Adjustment Program of intent to withdraw and all notices terminating tenancy and accompanying materials issued to the occupant. 3. For each Dwelling Unit where Developer asserts the occupant vacated the Dwelling Unit pursuant to an agreement that fully complies with the Oakland Tenant Move Out Agreement Ordinance, Oakland Municipal Code Section 8.22.700 et seq., evidence that the Developer has filed with the Rent Adjustment Program a Property Owner Certification prior to entering Move Out negotiations, and an executed Move-Out Agreement. 4. For each Dwelling Unit where Developer asserts the occupant voluntarily vacated the Dwelling Unit with no undue pressure, coercion, harassment, or misrepresentations of law or fact from the landlord or their agent, a certification under penalty of perjury with a description of the means by which the occupant vacated the unit along with any supporting documentation

--- Chunk 1387 ---
including correspondence from the occupant. 5. If any relocation payments were required under any article of Oakland Municipal Code Chapter 8.22, or if any relocation payments were voluntarily provided, a description and documentation of such relocation payments. --- Page 796 --- OAKLAND 796 17.122.070 – Right of First Refusal. A. Upon completion of the Replacement Deed-Restricted Units, occupants of Protected Units who were Lower Income Households in possession of the Protected Unit on the date the application to develop was submitted to the Planning and Building Department shall have the right of first refusal to rent a new Dwelling Unit of Equivalent Size in the housing development affordable to the household at an Affordable Rent for the Lower Income category which corresponds to their income or, if the new units are sold, at an Affordable Housing Cost. 1. This subparagraph shall not apply if the development project involving the Demolition of Protected Units consists of a single residential unit located on a site with a single Protected Unit. 2. A household that is otherwise eligible for the right of first refusal under this subsection A may be required to certify their household income and fulfill other eligibility requirements. If the

--- Chunk 1388 ---
household is no longer eligible because of an increase in household income, the developer shall not be excused of the obligation under this Chapter and under the executed regulatory agreement to make the unit available to a lower income household. If the completed project includes a deed-restricted moderate-income unit for which the household is eligible, the developer shall extend the right of first refusal to the household for that moderate-income unit. Otherwise, the developer shall offer a unit at market rent or market price to that household who holds a right of first refusal but who is no longer eligible for an affordable unit. 3. An occupant who agreed to enter into a move out agreement and who otherwise is entitled to a right of first refusal pursuant to this Chapter shall remain entitled to the right of first refusal. B. In cases where a Developer has constructed a housing development in which 100 percent of the Dwelling Units, exclusive of manager’s units, are reserved for Lower Income households, occupants of Protected Units who were in possession at the date the application to develop was submitted to the Planning and Building Department shall be granted a right of first refusal

--- Chunk 1389 ---
for a unit at the newly constructed building subject to their ability to meet income qualifications and other applicable eligibility requirements when the new Dwelling Units are ready for occupancy. However, in no case shall a returning occupant with a right of first refusal be denied a Replacement Deed-Restricted Unit because their household income is too low to qualify or because the occupant fails to meet eligibility criteria based on immigration status. C. Where an occupant has a right of first refusal pursuant to this section, the Developer shall notify the occupant at least sixty (60) days in advance of the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or certificate of occupancy for the building in which the unit is located. The City shall provide the list of contact information based on information provided by prior occupants as included in the Unit Inventory, the addenda thereto, and any additional contact information received by the City, if any. The notice must include the following information: 1. The fact that the new units have been completed. --- Page 797 --- OAKLAND 797 2. Information on the square footage and number of bedrooms in the unit being made available. 3. Information on whether

--- Chunk 1390 ---
units are available for rent or for purchase. 4. Information on the former occupant’s entitlement to reoccupy the building based on the household income status. 5. A table listing income thresholds and the rent or purchase price not to exceed based on household size. 6. Notice that if the occupant wishes to claim a unit in the new building, that they must reply within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. 7. If available for rent, notice that if the prior occupant chooses to claim a new unit for rent, it will be held for the prior occupant for sixty (60) days from the date of reply. 8. If available for purchase, notice that if the prior occupant chooses to claim a new unit for purchase, they must enter into a contract for purchase no later than ninety (90) days after the sales program begins. D. In the case of rental of a new Dwelling Unit, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of availability, a prior occupant must notify the prospective landlord if they wish to rent the new Dwelling Unit. The landlord must hold the Dwelling Unit vacant at no cost to the prior occupant

--- Chunk 1391 ---
for sixty (60) days from the date the prior occupant’s written notice of its intent to reoccupy the rental unit is received. The lease agreement for the new rental unit shall contain substantially the same terms as the lease for the Protected Unit, except where otherwise required by law. E. In the case of a prior occupant’s purchase of a new Dwelling Unit, the prior occupant shall have the option to purchase a new Dwelling Unit at an Affordable Housing Cost for the lower income category which corresponds to their income and upon the same or more favorable terms and conditions that such Dwelling Units are initially offered to the general public. Such right shall run for at least ninety (90) days from the date the sales program begins so long as the prior occupant is notified of their right to purchase in accordance with this section. 17.122.080 – Remedies. A. Administrative Remedies. 1. Administrative Citation. Any person violating any provision or failing to comply with any requirements of this Chapter may be assessed an administrative citation pursuant to O.M.C. Chapter 1.12 for the first offense. 2. Administrative Civil Penalties. Any person violating any provision or failing to comply with

--- Chunk 1393 ---
Attorney has sole discretion to determine whether to bring such an action. C. Nonexclusive Remedies and Penalties.

Tenant Rights and Privileges. All tenants of Replacement Deed-Restricted Units shall have the same rights and privileges of other tenants in the same building or complex, as applicable and if provided generally in the development, with respect to common space amenities, entry into the building, and building services, including access to laundry facilities, gardens or yards, health facilities and recreational space, property management and security services, repairs and maintenance, access to any parking spaces, access to doors and keys, and building rules and regulations. --- Page 799 --- OAKLAND 799 Chapter 17.124 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS Sections: 17.124.010 Title, purpose, and applicability. 17.124.020 Required landscape plan for new residential units and certain additions to Residential Facilities. 17.124.025 Required landscape plan for new Nonresidential Facilities and certain additions to Nonresidential Facilities. 17.124.030 Residential landscape requirements for street frontages. 17.124.040 Residential landscape requirements for downslope lots. 17.124.045 Trash and Utility Screening. 17.124.050

A. General Development Standards for Tower Telecommunications Facilities. 1. Applicant and owner shall allow other future wireless communications companies including public and quasi-public agencies using similar technology to collocate antenna equipment and facilities on the monopole unless specific technical or other constraints, subject to independent verification, at the applicant's expense, at the discretion of the City of Oakland Zoning Manager, prohibit said collocation. Applicant and other wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of cost in accordance with industry standards. Construction of future facilities shall not interrupt or interfere with the continuous operation of applicant's facilities. 2. The equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. The

--- Chunk 1429 ---
shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 3. When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height. 4. Antennas may not extend more than fifteen (15) feet above their supporting structure. 5. The applicant shall submit written documentation demonstrating that the emissions from the proposed project are within the limits set by the FCC. --- Page 815 --- OAKLAND 815 B. Design Review Criteria for Tower Telecommunications Facilities. In addition to the design review criteria listed in, the following specific additional criteria must be met when design review is required before an application can be granted: 1. Collocation is to be encouraged when it will decrease visual impact and collocation is to be discouraged when it will increase negative visual impact. 2. Towers should not be sited to create visual clutter or negatively affect specific views. 3. Towers shall be screened from the public view wherever possible. 4. The equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.

--- Chunk 1430 ---
5. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Wireless communication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 6. That all reasonable means of reducing public access to the antennas and equipment has been made, including, but not limited to, placement in or on buildings or structures, fencing, anti-climbing measures and anti-tampering devices. (Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 12768 § 3 (part), 2006; Ord. 11904 § 5.01 (part), 1996: prior planning code § 8509) 17.128.100 Regulations apply to parks and other similar open spaces. Telecommunications Facilities proposed in parks and other similar open spaces land shall be subject to the same regulations as set forth in the nearest Residential Zone. (Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 11904 § 5.01 (part), 1996: prior planning code § 8510) 17.128.110 Site location preferences. New

wireless facilities shall generally be located on the following properties or facilities in order of preference: A. Co-located on an existing structure or facility with existing wireless antennas. B. City-owned properties or other public or quasi-public facilities. C. Existing commercial or industrial structures in Nonresidential Zones (excluding all HBX Zones and the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones). D. Existing commercial or industrial structures in Residential Zones, HBX Zones, or the D- CE-3 or D-CE-4 Zones. E. Other Nonresidential uses in Residential Zones, HBX Zones, or the D-CE-3 or D-CE-4 Zones. --- Page 816 --- OAKLAND 816 F. Residential uses in Nonresidential Zones (excluding all HBX Zones and the D-CE-3 and D-CE-4 Zones). G. Residential uses in Residential Zones, HBX Zones, or the D-CE-3 or D-CE-4 Zones. Facilities locating on an A, B or C ranked preference do not require a site alternatives analysis. Facilities proposing to locate on a D through G ranked preference, inclusive, must submit a site alternatives analysis as part of the required application materials. A site alternatives analysis shall, at a minimum, consist of: a. The identification of all A, B and C ranked preference sites within one thousand (1,000) feet of the proposed location. If more

--- Chunk 1432 ---
than three (3) sites in each preference order exist, the three such closest to the proposed location shall be required. b. Written evidence indicating why each such identified alternative cannot be used. Such evidence shall be in sufficient detail that independent verification, at the applicant's expense, could be obtained if required by the City of Oakland Zoning Manager. Evidence should indicate if the reason an alternative was rejected was technical (e.g. incorrect height, interference from existing RF sources, inability to cover required area) or for other concerns (e.g. refusal to lease, inability to provide utilities). (Ord. No. 13168, § 5(Exh. A-2), 6-18-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. No. 13060, § 2(Exh. A), 3-1-2011; Ord. 12768, § 3 (part), 2006) 17.128.120 Site design preferences.

Building or structure mounted antennas set back from roof edge, not visible from public right-of way. C. Building or structure mounted antennas below roof line (facade mount, pole mount) visible from public right-of-way, painted to match existing structure. D. Building or structure mounted antennas above roof line visible from public

--- Chunk 1433 ---
right-of-way. E. Monopoles. F. Towers. Facilities designed to meet an A or B ranked preference do not require a site design alternatives analysis. Facilities designed to meet a C through F ranked preference, inclusive, must submit a site design alternatives analysis as part of the required application materials. A site design alternatives analysis shall, at a minimum, consist of: a. Written evidence indicating why each such higher preference design alternative cannot be used. Such evidence shall be in sufficient detail that independent verification could be obtained if required by the City of Oakland Zoning Manager. Evidence should indicate if the reason an alternative was rejected was technical (e.g. incorrect height, interference from existing RF sources, inability to cover required area) or for other concerns (e.g. inability to provide utilities, construction or structural impediments).

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Administrative Procedures Generally. The purpose of these provisions is to set forth certain

--- Chunk 1435 ---
regulations that may or shall, depending on the situation, apply to all provisions of procedures and administration (Chapters 17.130 through 17.148). (Prior planning code § 9000) 17.130.020 Alternative notification procedures. A. Number of Owners and Occupants Greater than One Thousand (1,000). If the number of owners and occupants of real property to whom notice would be mailed or delivered pursuant to any provision of procedures and administration (Chapters 17.130 through 17.148) were to exceed one thousand (1,000), the Director of City Planning may, at his or her discretion, use or specify other alternative notification procedures deemed appropriate. Such decision may be appealed pursuant to the administration appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. B. Notification Requirements Not in the Public Interest. If the Director of City Planning finds that, due to the special circumstances of a specific application, there will be no negative impact on surrounding properties, and that the purposes of the zoning regulations and the public interest of the citizens of Oakland will not be served by rigidly following the notification requirements set forth in any provision of procedures and administration (Chapters 17.130 through 17.148), the Director may, at his or her discretion, vary the requirements set forth or may

--- Chunk 1436 ---
use other alternative notification procedures deemed appropriate. Such decision may be appealed pursuant to the administrative appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. C. Notification of Adjoining Jurisdictions. Whenever a provision of procedures and administration (Chapters 17.130 through 17.148) results in an adjoining jurisdiction falling within an area in which notices are to be mailed or delivered to Oakland property owners and --- Page 819 --- OAKLAND 819 occupants, such notice shall also be mailed or delivered to the Director of City or County Planning, whichever the case may be, in said jurisdiction. (Prior planning code § 9001) 17.130.030 Notice by mail. Notice by mail is deemed given on the date the notice is placed into the U.S. Mail system. (Prior planning code § 9002) 17.130.040 Procedure for resolving tie votes. A. Planning Commission is Final Decision-making Body. If, in a matter that is appealable to the Planning Commission or to the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee and in which the Commission or Committee is the final decision making body, and is unable to reach an affirmative decision to approve or deny an application, the initial decision by the Planning Director stands as a final decision if the Commission or Committee is unable

--- Chunk 1437 ---
to reach a decision the second time the matter appears on the Commission's or Committee's agenda and votes are taken. B. City Council is Final Decision-making Body. If, in the matter that is appealable to the City Council, the Planning Commission or the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee is unable to reach an affirmative decision to approve or deny an application, the Chair of the Commission, in his or her discretion, shall either: 1. Forward the matter to the City Council if the Chair determines that the Commission or Committee is deadlocked or if the application would otherwise be automatically Deemed Approved and the applicant has not agreed to waive the state or local Deemed Approved provisions; or 2. Request further votes on the matter at this meeting or at subsequent meetings, provided however that the Commission or Committee may not continue the matter if it would result in the application being Deemed Approved. A tie vote that is forwarded to the City Council, for the Council's decision, shall be considered a decision for purposes of any state or local Deemed Approved provisions, such that the application shall not be automatically Deemed Approved and any agreement between the Planning Director, Commission

--- Chunk 1438 ---
or Committee and the applicant extending the time of such automatic Deemed Approved shall include a statement to this effect. (Ord. 12376 § 3 (part), 2001: Ord. 11741 § 2, 1994: prior planning code § 9003) 17.130.050 Presentation and submittal of issues and/or evidence. A. Whenever, pursuant to the Oakland Planning Code, a matter of original jurisdiction, for which a hearing is required, is pending before the City Council or City Planning Commission, any interested party, while the hearing is open, may submit any issues and/or oral, written and/or documentary evidence to the City Council or the Commission, whichever is applicable, for its consideration. B. Whenever, pursuant to the Oakland Planning Code, an appeal for which a hearing is required is pending before the City Council, City Planning Commission, or the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee, the appellant may not submit any issues and/or oral, written --- Page 820 --- OAKLAND 820 and/or documentary evidence not previously submitted in the appeal form itself and presented: (a) prior to the close of the written public comment period for the underlying decision being appealed, in the case of appeals based on a decision by the Zoning Administrator or other administrative decisions, or (b)

The City may elect, in its sole discretion, to participate in the defense of said Action and the applicant shall reimburse the City for its reasonable legal costs and attorneys' fees. B. Within ten (10) calendar days of the filing of any Action as specified in Subsection A. above, the applicant shall execute a Letter of Agreement with the City, acceptable to the Office of the City Attorney, which memorializes the above obligations. These obligations and the Letter of Agreement shall survive termination, extinguishment or invalidation of the approval. Failure to timely execute the Letter of Agreement does not relieve the applicant of any of the obligations contained in this Section or any other requirements or conditions of approval that may be imposed by the City. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. 12899 § 4, Exh. A (part), 2008; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006) 17.130.070

(Ord. 12899 § 4, Exh. A (part), 2008) --- Page 821 --- OAKLAND 821 17.130.080 City Council consideration of legislative and adjudicatory actions. When a development application requires both legislative and adjudicatory actions, the entire application shall be considered by the City Council for final action. The City Council has the authority to consider and revise as appropriate (accept, reject, or modify) the adjudicatory land use decisions of the Planning Commission, regardless of whether an appeal to the City Council is filed challenging such adjudicatory land use decisions. (Ord. 12899 § 4, Exh. A (part), 2008) 17.130.090 Minor land use permits considered concurrently with Major permits. A. Any Minor land use-related permit and/or approval that is related to a development application that also includes any Major land use-related permit and/or approval shall be considered concurrently with the Major land

--- Chunk 1442 ---
use-related permit and/or approval, and shall follow all procedural requirements associated with City Planning Commission decisions. In this case, the entire application shall initially be considered by the City Planning Commission and may be appealed to the City Council, in accordance with the requirements for Major land use-related permit and/or approval or discretionary actions. B. Any Minor land use-related permit referred to the City Planning Commission for initial decision in order to be considered concurrently with any Major land use-related permit and/or approval shall still be considered a Minor land use-related permit and/or approval, and the required findings for said Minor land use-related permit and/or approval shall apply.

A. Title and Intent. The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Reasonable Accommodations Policy and Procedure Regulations. The intent of the Reasonable Accommodations Policy and Procedure regulations

--- Chunk 1443 ---
is to provide flexibility in the application of the Planning Code for individuals with a disability, when flexibility is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. This Chapter will facilitate compliance with federal and state fair housing laws, and promote housing opportunities for residents of Oakland. B. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a procedure for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing to make requests for reasonable accommodation in the application of Oakland’s zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and procedures pursuant to Section 3604(f)(3)(b) of Title 42 of the United States Code (the “Fair Housing Act”) and Section 12955 et seq. of the California Government Code (the “California Fair Employment and Housing Act”), which prohibit local government from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies and practices when these accommodations are necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. C. Applicability. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. 17.131.020

--- Chunk 1444 ---
Definitions. “Acts” means the “Fair Housing Act” (Section 3601 et seq. of Title 42 of the United States Code) and the “California Fair Employment and Housing Act” (Section 12955 et seq. of the California Government Code). “Person with a Disability” is any person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone who has a record of such impairment. Federal and State fair housing laws do not protect an individual’s current unlawful use of controlled substances or other drugs, unless that individual has a separate disability. --- Page 823 --- OAKLAND 823 “Request for Reasonable Accommodations” means a request to modify land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices, or procedures in order to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 17.131.030 Notice of Availability; Application Requirements. A. Notice of the City of Oakland’s Reasonable Accommodations Policy and Procedure shall be displayed at public information counters in the planning and building offices of the City. B. Any person (or his or her representative) who requires reasonable accommodation because of a disability shall make such a request to the

--- Chunk 1445 ---
City on a form provided by the Planning Director, or his or her designee. The application shall be accompanied by such information as may be required to enable review of the requested accommodation. City staff are available to assist with the completion of a reasonable accommodations request (see related Reasonable Accommodations Form for more information). C. Any information submitted as part of a reasonable accommodations request shall be kept confidential and shall be retained in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be made available for public inspection. D. Review with other land use or design review applications. If the project for which the request is being made also requires one or more unrelated discretionary approvals (including, but not limited to, design review, conditional use permit, variance or subdivision), then to the extent feasible, the applicant shall file the request for reasonable accommodation together with any unrelated application for discretionary approval. 17.131.040 Review procedures. A. Authority. The Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation and shall make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when those accommodations may

--- Chunk 1446 ---
be necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunities to use and enjoy the dwelling. 1. For requests for reasonable accommodation the Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall issue a written determination within a timely manner but no later than thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a complete application form and may: (1) grant the accommodation request; (2) grant the accommodation request subject to specified nondiscriminatory conditions of approval; or (3) deny the request. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal, if any, as specified in Section 17.131.070. The notice of determination shall be sent to the applicant by first class mail or in a format requested by the applicant. 2. For requests for reasonable accommodations involving any applications for discretionary approval, the application for reasonable accommodation shall be processed and considered separately from any discretionary elements of the same proposal. The Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall act on the request for reasonable accommodation within a timely manner but no later than thirty (30) days of the date of a complete application form; however, if the request for a reasonable accommodation cannot be effectuated until a final decision

--- Chunk 1447 ---
is rendered on the related discretionary approvals, a ‘‘provisional approval” can be granted within the 30 day time frame allowing the reasonable accommodation request to be implemented, or modified as needed to obtain the same goal, at the time of the final discretionary approval, and shall become --- Page 824 --- OAKLAND 824 final at the same time. The applications for discretionary approval shall be separately considered and shall be subject to the procedures for consideration specified in the applicable Planning Code Chapter, depending on the type of application. The appropriate decision-making body shall act on all discretionary permits, but not the reasonable accommodation request. B. Types of Requests 1. “Category A” Requests Requests for accommodation from development regulations not specified as a “Category B” request (see item 2 below), including but not limited to, setbacks, building height limits and parking regulations in the Planning Code, or for any additions to Residential Facilities which meet the definition of a “Small Project,” as defined in Section 17.136.030(B), shall be considered “Category A” requests. 2. “Category B” Requests Requests for accommodation from residential density regulations in the Planning Code; distance separation requirements in the Planning Code; land use activities not permitted by

--- Chunk 1448 ---
the Planning Code; any additions to Residential Facilities which meet the definition of “Regular design review” as defined in Section 17.136.040(A); and any other accommodations request, under the discretion of the Planning Director, shall be considered “Category B” requests. C. Procedure 1. The applicant shall submit a completed reasonable accommodation application form to the Planning Director, or his or her designee, or request assistance from City staff to complete the application. 2. Whenever reasonable accommodation is requested for a proposal also requiring one or more discretionary land use permits, including but not limited to a design review, conditional use permit, planned unit development permit, or variance, to the extent feasible the application for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted with the application for said permit(s). The reasonable accommodation request shall be processed and considered separately from any land use permits requested for the same proposal as specified in 17.131.040(2). 3. In reviewing a request for a reasonable accommodation, the Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall consider information in the completed reasonable accommodation application form, factors described in Section 17.131.050 and/or 17.131.060, and any additional information consistent with this Chapter. The Planning Director, or his or her designee, may consult

--- Chunk 1449 ---
with staff of the City’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Programs Division during the review period. 4. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 17.131.050 Criteria for “Category A” Requests A proposal will qualify for “Category A” Request if it meets each of the provisions set forth below. --- Page 825 --- OAKLAND 825 A. The proposal is limited to one or more of the types of work listed as “Category A” request in 17.131.040(B)(1); B. That the accommodation is necessary to afford people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling. 17.131.060 Findings for “Category B” Requests. In making a determination to grant a requested accommodation, the Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall make all of the following findings for “Category B” requests: 1. That the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by people with disabilities protected under fair housing laws. 2. That the accommodation is necessary to afford people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling; 3.

--- Chunk 1450 ---
That the requested accommodation will not require a fundamental alteration to zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and procedures; and 4. That the requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City. None of the findings of this Section are intended to supersede any other findings which might also be required for a discretionary permit that is reviewed concurrently with the request for accommodation (see Section 17.131.030(D)). 17.131.070 Finality of Decision and Appeal of Determination. A. “Category A” and “Category B” Requests. 1. For requests for reasonable accommodations not involving one or more unrelated land use permits, a decision by the Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of initial decision, unless appealed to the City Administrator by the applicant. In the event that the last date of appeal falls on a weekend, holiday or when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. Appeals considered by the City Administrator, in consultation with the City’s ADA Programs Division, shall be final immediately and are not appealable. 2. For requests for reasonable accommodations involving one

--- Chunk 1451 ---
or more land use permits, the Planning Director, or his or her designee, shall act on the request for reasonable accommodations, subject to the appeal process described in 17.131.070(A)(1) . The appeal periods in 17.131.070(A)(1) shall run from the date of the denial of the permit or the modification or denial of the provisional permit, whichever is later. The appropriate decision making body shall act on all discretionary permits including appeal processes for the discretionary permits. --- Page 826 --- OAKLAND 826 Chapter 17.132 ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL PROCEDURE Sections: 17.132.010 Title, purpose, and applicability. 17.132.020 Appeal. 17.132.030 Procedure for consideration. 17.132.040 Appeal to Council on transit line sign controls. 17.132.010 Title, purpose, and applicability. The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Administrative Appeal Procedure. The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe the procedure by which an appeal may be taken to the City Planning Commission or, if applicable, to the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee from any determination or interpretation made by the Director of City Planning under the zoning regulations. This procedure shall apply to all appeals from such determinations and interpretations. (Ord. 12376 § 3 (part), 2001: prior planning code § 9100) 17.132.020 Appeal. Within ten

--- Chunk 1452 ---
(10) calendar days after the date of any administrative determination or interpretation made by the Director of City Planning under the zoning regulations, an appeal from such decision may be taken to the City Planning Commission by any interested party. In the case of appeals involving One-Family or Two- to Four-Family Residential Facilities, the appeal shall be considered by the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee. Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such Department and shall be accompanied by such a fee as specified in the City fee schedule. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Planning Director or Zoning Manager or wherein his or her decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. The appeal shall be accompanied by such information as may be required to facilitate review. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Secretary of the City Planning Commission shall set the date for consideration thereof. Not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date of the Commission's or Committee's consideration of the appeal, written notice shall be given to: the

An application for a Major Conditional Use Permit shall be considered by the

--- Chunk 1462 ---
City Planning Commission which shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be given by posting an enlarged notice on the premises of the subject property involved in the application. Notice of the hearing shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property in the City within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. While the hearing is open, any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence to the Commission for its consideration; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Commission shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in Section 17.134.050 and to other applicable use permit criteria, and may grant or deny the application

--- Chunk 1463 ---
for the proposed conditional use permit or require such changes or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations and ensure conformity to said criteria. The determination of the Commission shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.134.070. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, in accordance with the above procedures.

An application for a Minor Conditional Use Permit shall be considered by the Director of City Planning. However, the Director may, at his or her discretion, refer the application to the City Planning Commission for decision rather than acting on it himself or herself. In this case, the application shall still be considered a minor permit, but shall be processed according to the procedure in Subsection A. of this Section. In these instances, any other minor permits associated with the application shall be considered concurrently by the Planning Commission, pursuant to Section 17.130.090. Notice shall be given by posting an enlarged notice on the premises of the subject property involved in the application; notice shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property in the City within three hundred (300) feet of the --- Page 832 --- OAKLAND 832 property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available

--- Chunk 1465 ---
equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing, if such is to be held, or, if not, for decision on the application by the Director. Any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence: (a) to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period for his or her consideration, or (b) to the Commission while the hearing is open for its consideration, whichever is applicable; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Director shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the general use permit criteria set forth in Section 17.134.050 and to other applicable use permit criteria, and may grant or deny the application for the proposed conditional use permit or require such changes in the proposed use or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in his or her judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations and ensure conformity to said criteria. The determination of the Director

--- Chunk 1466 ---
of City Planning shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Planning Commission in accordance with Section 17.134.060. In those cases which are referred to the Commission by the Planning Director, the decision of the Commission shall become final ten (10) days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.134.070. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented (a) to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period, or (b) to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, whichever is applicable, in accordance with the above procedures.

That the location, design, and

--- Chunk 1468 ---
site planning of the proposed development will provide a convenient and functional living, working, shopping, or civic environment; --- Page 833 --- OAKLAND 833 C.

The proposal when viewed in its entirety will not adversely impact abutting residences to the side, rear, or directly across the street with respect to solar access, view blockage and privacy to a degree greater than that which would be possible

--- Chunk 1469 ---
if the residence were built according to the applicable regulation, and, for Conditional Use Permits that allow height increases, the proposal provides detailing, articulation or other design treatments that mitigate any bulk created by the additional height; or 2. At least sixty percent (60%) of the lots in the immediate context are already developed and the proposal would not exceed the corresponding as-built condition on these lots, and, for conditional use permits that allow height increases, the proposal provides detailing, articulation or other design treatments that mitigate any bulk created by the additional height. The immediate context shall consist of the five (5) closest lots on each side of the project site plus the ten (10) closest lots on the opposite side of the street (see illustration I-4b); however, the Director of City Planning may make an alternative determination of immediate context based on specific site conditions. Such determination shall be in writing and included as part of any decision on any conditional use permit. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord.

Notice of each hearing shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. Notice shall also be provided to those community or neighborhood groups included in the Planning and Building Department database that are

Any project in the OS Zone requiring a major or minor conditional use permit shall be subject to review by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board (LPAB) if that project is located: A. Within the S-7 Zone; B. On a site that could potentially impact a structure, site, or feature that is listed on the State or National Registers, or that has been formally designated as an Oakland landmark. For projects requiring a minor conditional use permit, this review shall be

--- Chunk 1490 ---
made after the public hearing of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission and before the final decision of the Director of City Planning. For projects requiring a major conditional use permit, this review shall be made after the public hearing of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission and before the public hearing of the City Planning Commission. The Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board may recommend modifications to the project that it deems necessary to ensure that the historic value of the structure, site, or feature is not adversely impacted. If no action is taken by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the application, the project will be forwarded to the Planning Commission (for major conditional use permits) or the Director of City Planning (for minor conditional use permits).

Park Master Plans for City-Owned Parks. Initial consideration of a Park Master Plan shall be made through a Major Conditional Use Permit application to the Planning and Building Department. A Major Conditional Use Permit for a

--- Chunk 1491 ---
Park Master Plan shall be considered first by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission (PRAC) and second by the City Planning Commission, except in cases also requiring referral to the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board (LPAB) as specified in Section 17.135.040, in which case this review shall be made second before the hearing by the City Planning Commission. After receiving the advice of the Planning Commission, the City Council shall hold a hearing and decide on the Park Master Plan. 1. Projects Consistent with Park Master Plans. Any improvement or change in use that is consistent with a Park Master Plan that has been adopted by the Oakland City Council shall not require a Conditional Use Permit, even where they involve facilities or activities that would otherwise require a Major or Minor Conditional Use Permit in Section 17.11.060. Projects shall be eligible for this provision only if the Master Plan in question has been adopted by the Oakland City Council within fifteen (15) years of the date of the improvement or change in use application, or has been amended or updated with Council approval within fifteen (15) years of the date of the improvement or change in use application. The determination

--- Chunk 1492 ---
that a project is consistent with a Park Master Plan shall be made by the Director of City Planning, or his or her designee. B. Projects in East Bay Regional Parks. Any improvement or change in use on land owned by the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) shall be subject to the development standards contained in this Chapter. However, in accordance with Section 17.11.060, such projects shall not require a Conditional Use Permit if they are park, recreational, or civic uses that are consistent with a Park Land Use Plan or equivalent land use planning document adopted by the EBRPD Board. In the event a land use plan or equivalent document does not exist or must be amended to accommodate the facility, preparation/amendment of such a plan by the EBRPD will be required prior to issuance of a building permit for future improvements. Such plans and plan amendments shall require public notice to abutting property owners and occupants, and to the Oakland Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission, City Planning Commission, and City Council at least forty-five (45) days prior to adoption by the Park Board in order to ensure opportunity for public comment from Oakland residents. (Ord. 12078 §

4 (part), 1998) 17.135.060 No net loss tracking. A. Beginning on the effective date of the OS Zone regulations, the Oakland City Administrator's Office shall establish an open space tracking system. The tracking system shall be maintained in a publicly accessible format and shall be updated on a continuous basis as additions and subtractions are made to the city's park system. Beginning on the effective date of these regulations, all enclosed facilities in urban parks which exceed one hundred (100) square feet shall be tracked and recorded as "subtractions" from a baseline figure of zero. All acquisition of parkland or creation of new useable public open space shall be tracked and recorded as "additions." Only land which is improved or intended for improvement to urban park standards may be counted as "additions"; acquisition of Resource Conservation Area land is excluded. The city shall strongly encourage actions which result in a net gain of open space; in other words, a condition where the "additions" of open space in the tracking system exceed the "subtractions" resulting from new buildings and structure coverage. --- Page 842 --- OAKLAND 842 B. Unless overriding considerations exist, approval of any increase in structure coverage within the

--- Chunk 1494 ---
OS Zone shall be contingent on a finding that there has been no net loss of urban parkland from the time of the baseline date. If this finding cannot be made, approval shall be conditioned upon provision of replacement open space of comparable value and of an area equal to or greater than the space covered which shall be made available concurrently. Land within the jurisdiction of the Port of Oakland is exempt from this requirement and shall be excluded from this calculation. (Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh.

Prior to application for Regular Design Review, any applicant or his or her representative seeking early project feedback may submit for a pre-application review of the proposal by a representative of the City Planning and Building Department. For projects of a larger scale or involving a significant policy issue, the Director of City Planning may, at his or her discretion, request that an applicant or his or her representative submit for a pre-application review of the proposal. During a pre-application review, the City representative will provide information about applicable design review criteria --- Page 853 --- OAKLAND 853 and pertinent procedures, including the opportunity for advice from outside design professionals. Where appropriate the City representative may also informally discuss possible design solutions, point out potential neighborhood concerns, and mention local organizations which the applicant is encouraged to contact before

--- Chunk 1519 ---
finalizing the proposal. C. Procedure for Consideration of Regular Design Review Proposals which Involve an Initial Decision by the Director of City Planning—Decisions Not Ultimately Appealable to City Council. 1. Decision by the Director of City Planning. An application for Regular Design Review that is not referred to the City Planning Commission for initial decision as specified in Section 17.136.040(D) shall be considered by the Director of City Planning. 2. Notification Procedures. Notice shall be given by posting an enlarged notice at a location on the project site that is clearly visible from the street, alley, or private way providing access to the subject lot. Notice shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants within three hundred (300) feet of the project site; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for decision on the application by the Director. During the required noticing period, the Planning and Building department shall receive and consider comments

--- Chunk 1520 ---
from any interested party. 3. The Director or the applicant may seek the advice of outside design professionals. Any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or evidence to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period for his or her consideration; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Director shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the applicable design review criteria, and may approve or disapprove the proposal or require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in his or her judgment necessary to ensure conformity to said criteria. 4. Finality of Decision. A decision by the Director shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of initial decision unless appealed to the City Planning Commission or the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee in accordance with Section 17.136.080. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period. In the event that the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices

--- Chunk 1521 ---
are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. Appeals considered by the City Planning Commission or the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee under the procedures specified in Section 17.136.080 shall be final immediately and are not ultimately appealable to the City Council. D. Procedure for Consideration of Regular Design Review Proposals which Involve an Initial Decision by the City Planning Commission—Decisions Ultimately Appealable to City Council. 1. Decision by the City Planning Commission. The Director of City Planning may, at his or her discretion, refer an application for Regular Design Review to the City Planning Commission for an initial decision rather than acting on it himself or herself. In this case, the application shall still be considered a minor permit, but shall be processed according to the procedure in this Subsection. In these instances, any other minor permits associated with the application shall be considered concurrently by the Planning Commission, pursuant to Section 17.130.090. However, if the project involves a major variance or major conditional use permit; requires an Environmental Impact Report (EIR); or results in more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of new nonresidential --- Page 854 --- OAKLAND

--- Chunk 1522 ---
854 floor area and is located in any zone other than the (when not combined with the S-7 Zone or in the D-DT-JLI Zone) D-LM, D-CO, or S-15 Zones, the Director of City Planning shall refer the application to the City Planning Commission for an initial decision rather than acting on it himself or herself. 2. Notification Procedures. Notice shall be given by posting an enlarged notice at a location on the project site that is clearly visible from the street, alley, or private way providing access to the subject lot. Notice shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants within three hundred (300) feet of the project site; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for a hearing before the Commission. During the required noticing period, the Planning and Building department shall receive and consider comments from any interested party. 3. The Planning Commission may seek the advice of outside design professionals.

--- Chunk 1523 ---
While the hearing is open, any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence to the Commission for its consideration; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Commission shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the applicable design review criteria, and may approve or disapprove the proposal or require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in his or her or its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to said criteria. 4. Finality of Decision. The initial decision of the Planning Commission shall become final ten (10) days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.136.090. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, in accordance with the above procedures. In the event that the last day of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date

--- Chunk 1524 ---
of appeal. E. Alternative Notification Procedures. If the conditions as set forth in Section 17.130.020 apply, alternative notification procedures discussed therein may replace or supplement the procedures set forth in Subsections C. and D. of this Section. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13168, § 5(Exh. A-2), 6-18-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. No. 13028, § 2(Exh. A), 7-20-2010; Ord. No. 12999, § 4(Exh.

Regular design review approval may be granted only if the proposal conforms to all of the following general design review criteria, as well as to any and all other applicable design review criteria: A. For Residential Facilities. 1. That the proposed design will create a building or set of buildings that are well related to the surrounding area in their setting, scale, bulk, height, materials, and --- Page 855 ---

--- Chunk 1525 ---
OAKLAND 855 textures; 2. That the proposed design will be sensitive to the topography and landscape; 3. That, if situated on a hill, the design and massing of the proposed building relates to the grade of the hill; 4. That the proposed design conforms in all significant respects with the Oakland General Plan and with any applicable design review guidelines or criteria, district plan, or development control map which have been adopted by the Planning Commission or City Council. B. For Nonresidential Facilities and Signs. 1. That the proposal will help achieve or maintain a group of facilities which are well related to one another and which, when taken together, will result in a well- composed design, with consideration given to site, landscape, bulk, height, arrangement, texture, materials, colors, and appurtenances; the relation of these factors to other facilities in the vicinity; and the relation of the proposal to the total setting as seen from key points in the surrounding area. Only elements of design which have some significant relationship to outside appearance shall be considered, except as otherwise provided in Section 17.136.060; 2. That the proposed design will be of a quality and character which harmonizes with, and serves

--- Chunk 1526 ---
to protect the value of, private and public investments in the area; 3. That the proposed design conforms in all significant respects with the Oakland General Plan and with any applicable design review guidelines or criteria, district plan, or development control map which have been adopted by the Planning Commission or City Council. C. For Local Register Properties that are not Landmarks or located in the S-7 or S-20 Zone: 1. That for additions or alterations, the proposal will not substantially impair the visual, architectural, or historic value of the affected site or facility. Consideration shall he given to design, form, scale, materials, texture, lighting, landscaping, Signs, and any other relevant design element or effect, and, where applicable, the relation of the above to the original design of the affected facility. D. For Potential Designated Historic Properties that are not Local Register Properties: That for additions or alterations, 1. The design matches or is compatible with, but not necessarily identical to, the property's existing or historical design; or 2. The proposed design comprehensively modifies and is at least equal in quality to the existing design and is compatible with the character of the neighborhood; or 3. The existing design is

--- Chunk 1527 ---
undistinguished and does not warrant retention and the proposed design is compatible with the character of the neighborhood. E. For Retaining Walls: 1. That the retaining wall is consistent with the overall building and site design and respects the natural landscape and topography of the site and surrounding areas; 2. That the retaining wall is responsive to human scale, avoiding large, blank, uninterrupted or undesigned vertical surfaces; 3. That the retaining wall respects the natural topography, avoiding obvious scars on the land; --- Page 856 --- OAKLAND 856 4. That the proposed design conforms in all significant respects with the Oakland General Plan and with any applicable design review guidelines or criteria, district plan, or development control map which have been adopted by the Planning Commission or City Council. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13090, § 4(Exh. A), 10-4-2011; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 12376 § 3 (part), 2001: Ord. 11816 § 2 (part), 1995; prior planning code § 9306) 17.136.055 Special regulations for historic properties in the Downtown District (D-DT) and the Lake Merritt Station Area District (D-LM) Zones. A. The provisions of this Section shall only apply to proposals in

--- Chunk 1528 ---
the Downtown District (D-DT). B. Findings. 1. Any exterior alteration to a character-defining element of a Designated Historic Property (DHP) or Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) that: 1) does not match its exterior historical materials or appearance, and 2) is part of the existing building (not part of any proposed addition) shall be required to meet any applicable criteria in Chapter 17.136 and meet findings (a) and (b), below. The determination of whether a project meets these findings requires consultation with Historic Preservation staff. a. Any replacements of exterior character-defining elements are required because repair is not feasible. "Character-defining elements" are those features of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location, and association that identify a property as representative of its period and contribute to its visual distinction or historical significance; and b. Consultation with Historic Preservation staff has determined that any replacement or repair that differs from the original feature is compatible with the character of the building, Area of Primary Importance (API) or Area of Secondary Importance (ASI), if applicable, and retains the character-defining appearance of the feature. 2. Approval of applications for projects in an API that require Regular Design Review approval may be granted only upon determination that

--- Chunk 1529 ---
the proposal conforms to any applicable criteria in Chapter 17.136 and to the following additional criteria: a. Any proposed new construction is compatible with the existing API in terms of massing, siting, rhythm, composition, patterns of openings, quality of material, and intensity of detailing; b. New street frontage has forms that reflect the widths and rhythm of the facades on the street, and entrances that reflect the patterns on the street; c. The proposal provides high visual interest that either reflects the level and quality of visual interest of the API contributors or otherwise enhances the visual interest of the API; d. The proposal is consistent with the visual cohesiveness of the API. For the purpose of this finding, visual cohesiveness is the architectural character, the sum of all visual aspects, features, and materials that defines the API. A new structure contributes to the visual cohesiveness of a district if it relates to the design characteristics of a historic district while also conveying its own time. New construction may do so by drawing upon some basic building features, such as the way in which a building is located on its site, the manner in which it relates to the street,

--- Chunk 1530 ---
its basic mass, form, direction or orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), recesses and projections, quality of materials, patterns of openings and level of detailing. When some combination of --- Page 857 --- OAKLAND 857 these design variables are arranged in a new building to relate to those seen traditionally in the area, but integral to the design and character of the proposed new construction, visual cohesiveness results; e. Where height is a character-defining element of the API there are height transitions to any neighboring contributing historic buildings. "Character-defining elements" are those features of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location, and association that identify a property as representative of its period and contribute to its visual distinction or historical significance. APIs with a character-defining height and their character-defining height level are designated on the zoning maps; and f. For additions, the proposal meets either: 1) Secretary of Interior's standards for the treatment of historic resources; 2) the proposal will not adversely affect the character of the property or API; or, 3) upon the granting of a conditional use permit, (see Chapter 17.134 for the CUP procedure) and a hearing in front of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board for its recommendations, a project meets

--- Chunk 1531 ---
the additional findings in Subsection g., below. g. For construction of new principal buildings: i. The project will not cause the API to lose its status as an API; ii. The proposal will result in a building or addition with exterior visual quality, craftsmanship, detailing, and high quality and durable materials that is at least equal to that of the API contributors; and iii. The proposal contains elements that relate to the character-defining height of the API, if any, through the use of a combination of upper story setbacks, window patterns, change of materials, prominent cornice lines, or other techniques. APIs with a character-defining height and their character-defining height level are designated on the zoning maps. 3. Approval of an application for a project that requires Regular Design Review Approval involving a DHP or PDHP outside of an API may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to any applicable criteria in Chapter 17.136 and either meets each criteria (a), (b), and (c), or only (d), below: a. Any proposed new construction is compatible with the existing district and/or building in terms of massing, siting, rhythm, composition, patterns of openings, quality of material, and intensity of detailing; b.

--- Chunk 1532 ---
The proposal reflects the quality and visual interest of the building and/or ASI, or otherwise enhances the visual interest of the building or ASI; c. The proposal does not disqualify an ASI as an ASI; and d. If a project does not meet either finding (a), (b), or (c), above, approval of applications for projects may still be granted, but only after a hearing in front of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board for its recommendations and determination that the proposal meets the following criteria: The proposal will result in a signature building within the neighborhood, City, or region based on qualities including, but not necessarily limited to, exterior visual quality, craftsmanship, detailing, and high quality and durable materials. C. Required Hearings in Front of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board (LPAB). 1. Prior to project approval, the following projects require a hearing in front of the LPAB for its recommendations and/or advice to the decision making body: --- Page 858 --- OAKLAND 858 a. Any construction of a new principal building in an API; b. An addition to an API contributor when required by Subsection 17.136.055.B.2.f. c. With the exception of additions that are not visible from a street or other

--- Chunk 1533 ---
public area, projects in an API that would result in a building taller than the character-defining height of the district, if any. Districts with a character-defining height and their character-defining height levels are designated on the zoning maps. An addition is considered "visible from a street or other public area" if it is located within the "critical design area," defined as the area within forty (40) feet of any street line, public alley, public path, park or other public area. d. New construction or an addition to a building when required by Subsection 17.136.055.B.3.d. e. Any proposal involving a Local Register Property that requires Regular Design Review approval. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 12955, § 2(Exh. A), 7-21-2009) 17.136.060 Review by Landmarks Board in certain cases. A. Whenever an application is for regular design review in the S-7 Zone, or on a designated landmark site, the Director of City Planning shall refer the proposal to the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board for its recommendations. B. Whenever an application is for regular design review in the S-20 Zone, and the Director of City Planning determines that a proposed addition or alteration will have a significant effect on the

--- Chunk 1534 ---
property's character-defining elements that are visible from a street or other public area, the Director may, at his or her discretion, refer the project to the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board for its recommendations. "Character-defining elements" are those features of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location, and association that identify a property as representative of its period and contribute to its visual distinction or historical significance. An addition or alteration is normally considered "visible from a street or other public area" if it affects a street face or public face of the facility or is otherwise located within the "critical design area," defined as the area within forty (40) feet of any street line, public alley, public path, park or other public area. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 11816 § 2 (part), 1995: prior planning code § 9303) 17.136.070 Special regulations for designated landmarks. A. Designation. In any zone, the City Council may designate as a landmark any facility, portion thereof, or group of facilities which has special character, interest, or value of any of the types referred to in Section 17.07.030P. The designating ordinance for each landmark shall include a

--- Chunk 1535 ---
description of the characteristics of the landmark which justify its designation and a clear description of the particular features that should be preserved. Each ordinance shall also include the location and boundaries of a landmark site, which shall be the lot, or other appropriate immediate setting, containing the landmark. Designation of each landmark and landmark site shall be pursuant to the rezoning and law change procedure in Chapter 17.144. B. Design Review for Construction or Alteration. Except for projects that are exempt from design review as set forth in Section 17.136.025, no Building Facility, Telecommunications Facility, Sign, or other associated structure on any designated landmark site shall be --- Page 859 --- OAKLAND 859 constructed or established, or altered in such a manner as to affect exterior appearance unless plans for the proposal have been approved pursuant to the design review procedure in this Chapter and the applicable provisions of this Section. Furthermore, for a publicly- owned landmark, the designating ordinance may require such approval of proposed changes to major interior architectural features. C. Regular Design Review Criteria. Proposals involving designated landmarks that require Regular design review approval may be granted only upon determination that the proposal conforms to the

--- Chunk 1536 ---
Regular design review criteria set forth in Section 17.136.050 and to the additional criteria set forth below in Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 or to one or both of the criteria set forth in Subdivision 4: 1. That the proposal will not adversely affect the exterior features of the designated landmark nor, when subject to control as specified in the designating ordinance for a publicly-owned landmark, its major interior architectural features; 2. That the proposal will not adversely affect the special character, interest, or value of the landmark and its site, as viewed both in themselves and in their setting; 3. That the proposal conforms with the Design Guidelines for Landmarks and Preservation Districts as adopted by the City Planning Commission and, as applicable for certain federally-related projects, with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties; 4. If the proposal does not conform to the criteria set forth in Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3: i. That the designated landmark or portion thereof is in such condition that it is not architecturally feasible to preserve or restore it, or ii. That, considering the economic feasibility of alternatives to the proposal, and balancing the interest of the

--- Chunk 1537 ---
public in protecting the designated landmark or portion thereof, and the interest of the owner of the landmark site in the utilization thereof, approval is required by considerations of equity. D. Duty to Keep in Good Repair. Except as otherwise authorized under Subsections B. and C. of this Section, the owner, lessee, or other person in actual charge of each designated landmark shall keep good repair all of the exterior portions thereof, all of the interior portions thereof when subject to control as specified in the designating ordinance, and all interior portions thereof the maintenance of which is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of any exterior portion. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13028, § 2(Exh. A), 7-20-2010; Ord. No. 12999, § 4(Exh. A), 3-16-2010; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 12513 Attach. A (part), 2003: Ord. 12237 § 4 (part), 2000; prior planning code § 7002) 17.136.075 Regulations for demolition or removal of CIX-1A zoned properties, Designated Historic Properties, and Potentially Designated Historic Properties. A. With the exception of structures declared to be a public nuisance by the Building Official or City Council, Regular Design Review of the demolition or removal of

--- Chunk 1538 ---
a Designated Historic Property (DHP) or Potentially Designated Historic Property (PDHP) shall only be approved after the Regular Design Review of a replacement project at the subject site has been approved; however, demolition of nuisance structures must still undergo Regular Design Review for demolition as required by this Chapter. --- Page 860 --- OAKLAND 860 B. Regular Design Review approval for the demolition or removal of any Landmark, Heritage Property, structure rated "A" or "B" by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey, and structure on the City's Preservation Study List that are not in an S-7 or S-20 Zone, or Area of Primary Importance (API) as determined by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey may be granted only if the proposal conforms to the Regular design review criteria, all other applicable design review criteria, and the following additional criteria: 1. The applicant demonstrates that: a) the existing property has no reasonable use or cannot generate a reasonable economic return and that the development replacing it will provide such use or generate such return, or b) the applicant demonstrates that the structure constitutes a hazard and is economically infeasible to rehabilitate on its present site. For this finding, a hazard constitutes a threat

--- Chunk 1539 ---
to health and safety that is not immediate; 2. If a replacement facility is required by Subsection 17.136.075.A., the design quality of the replacement facility is equal or superior to that of the existing facility; and 3. It is economically, functionally architecturally, or structurally infeasible to incorporate the historic structure into the proposed development. C. Regular Design Review Approval for the demolition or removal of any structure in the CIX- 1A Zone, or an S-7 or S-20 Zone, or an Area of Primary Importance (API) as determined by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey may be granted only if the proposal conforms to the general design review criteria, all other applicable design review criteria, and the following additional criteria: 1. For the demolition of structures in the CIX-1A Zone; or contributors to an S-7 Zone, S- 20 Zone, or API: a. The applicant demonstrates that: i) the existing property has no reasonable use or cannot generate a reasonable economic return and that the development replacing it will provide such use or generates such return, or ii) the applicant demonstrates that the structure constitutes a hazard and is economically infeasible to rehabilitate on its present site. For this criterion, a hazard constitutes

--- Chunk 1540 ---
a threat to health and safety that is not immediate; and b. It is economically, functionally, architecturally, or structurally infeasible to incorporate the historic structure, or existing structure in the CIX-1A Zone, into the proposed development. 2. For the demolition of noncontributors to an S-7 Zone, S-20 Zone, or API: The existing structure is either: i) seriously deteriorated or a hazard; or ii) the existing design is undistinguished and does not warrant retention. For this finding, a hazard constitutes a threat to health and safety that is not immediate; 3. For the demolition of any structure in an S-7 Zone, S-20 Zone, or API: a. The design quality of the replacement structure is equal/superior to that of the existing structure; and b. The design of the replacement project is compatible with the character of the district, and there is no erosion of design quality at the replacement project site and in the surrounding area. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following additional findings: --- Page 861 --- OAKLAND 861 i. The replacement project is compatible with the district in terms of massing, siting, rhythm, composition, patterns of openings, quality of material, and intensity of detailing; ii. New

--- Chunk 1541 ---
street frontage includes forms that reflect the widths and rhythm of the facades on the street and entrances that reflect the patterns on the street; iii. The replacement project provides high visual interest that either reflects the level and quality of visual interest of the district contributors or otherwise enhances the visual interest of the district; iv. If the design contrasts the new to the historic character, the replacement project enriches the historic character of the district; v. The replacement project is consistent with the visual cohesiveness of the district. For the purpose of this item, visual cohesiveness is the architectural character, the sum of all visual aspects, features, and materials that defines the district. A new structure contributes to the visual cohesiveness of a district if it relates to the design characteristics of a historic district. New construction may do so by drawing upon some basic building features, such as the way in which a building is located on its site, the manner in which it relates to the street, its basic mass, form, direction or orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), recesses and projections, quality of materials, patterns of openings and level of detailing. When a combination of some of

--- Chunk 1542 ---
these design variables are arranged in a new building to relate to those seen traditionally in the area, but integral to the design and character of the proposed new construction, visual cohesiveness results; and vi. The replacement project will not cause the district to lose its current historic status. D. Regular Design Review Approval for the demolition or removal of any structure rated "C" by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey or contributes to an Area of Secondary Importance (ASI) as determined by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey may be granted only if the proposal conforms to the general design review criteria, all other applicable design review criteria, and to either: 1., 2., or 3., below: 1. The design quality of the proposed replacement project is at least equal to that of the original structure and the proposed replacement project is compatible with the character of the neighborhood; or 2. The public benefits of the proposed replacement project outweigh the benefit of retaining the original structure and the proposed replacement project is compatible with the character of the neighborhood; or 3. The existing design is undistinguished and does not warrant retention and the proposed design is compatible with the character of

--- Chunk 1543 ---
the neighborhood. E. For proposals that have received Design Review approval pursuant to this Section, the issuance of a demolition permit for any structure or portion thereof may be postponed by the Director of City Planning for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of application for such permit. The Director may do so upon determination that the structure or portion thereof is listed as a Local Register Property, or is on a study list of facilities under serious study by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, the City Planning Commission, or the Director, for possible landmark designation under Section 17.136.070 or for other appropriate action to preserve it. During the period of postponement --- Page 862 --- OAKLAND 862 the Board, the Commission, or the Director shall explore means for preserving or restoring the structure or portion thereof. However, demolition may not be postponed under this Section if, after notice to the Director of City Planning, the Building Services Department, the Housing Conservation Division, their respective appeals boards, or the City Council determines that immediate demolition is necessary to protect the public health or safety. Any determination made by the Director of City Planning

--- Chunk 1544 ---
under this Section may be appealed pursuant to the administrative appeal procedure in Chapter 17.132. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. No. 13028, § 2(Exh. A), 7-20-2010) Editor's note— Ord. No. 13028, § 2(Exh. A), adopted July 20, 2010, amended Section 17.136.075 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, Section 17.136.075 pertained to postponement of demolition, and derived from the prior planning code, § 7005, and Ord. No. 12776, § 3, Exh. A (part), adopted in 2006. 17.136.080 Appeal to Planning Commission—Regular design review. Within ten (10) calendar days after the date of initial decision by the Director of City Planning on an application for Regular design review under the procedure specified in Subsection 17.136.040.C, an appeal from said decision may be taken to the City Planning Commission by the applicant, the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, or any other interested party. In the case of appeals involving One-Family or Two- to Four-Family Residential Facilities, the appeal shall be considered by the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee. In the event the last day of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date offices

--- Chunk 1545 ---
are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the City Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such Department, along with the appropriate fees required by the City's Master Fee Schedule. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Director or wherein his or her decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, previously presented to the Director of City Planning prior to the close of the written public comment period on the item, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal and/or in court. The appeal is not de novo. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Secretary of the City Planning Commission shall set the time for consideration thereof. Not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date of the Commission's or Committee's consideration of the appeal, written notice shall be given

--- Chunk 1546 ---
to: the applicant; the appellant in those cases where the applicant is not the appellant; adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as the Secretary deems appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal. During the hearing on the appeal, the appellant will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Director of City Planning prior to the close of the written public comment period for the underlying decision being appealed, as the appeal is not de novo. The appellant shall not be permitted to present any other issues and/or evidence (written, oral, or otherwise) during the appeal process. In considering the appeal, the Commission or, if applicable, the Committee shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the applicable design review criteria, and may approve or disapprove the proposal or require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to --- Page 863 --- OAKLAND 863 ensure conformity to said criteria. The Commission or, if applicable, the Committee may seek the advice

--- Chunk 1547 ---
of outside design professionals. The decision of the Commission or, if applicable, the Committee on a proposal being considered under the procedure specified in Subsection 17.136.040.C. shall be final immediately and is not ultimately appealable to the City Council.

Within ten (10) calendar days after the date of initial decision by the City Planning Commission on an application for Regular design review under the procedure specified in Subsection 17.136.040.D, an appeal from said decision may be taken to the City Council by the applicant, the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board, or any other interested party. In the event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. No such appeal to the City Council is allowable under the procedure specified in Subsection 17.136.040.C. Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed

--- Chunk 1548 ---
by the Planning Director and shall be filed with the Planning and Building Department, along with the appropriate fees required by the City's Master Fee Schedule. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Commission or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, previously presented to City Planning Commission prior to the close of its public hearing on the item, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal and/or in court. The appeal is not de novo. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Council shall set the date for consideration thereof. After setting the hearing date, the Council, prior to hearing the appeal, may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further consideration and advice. Appeals referred to the Planning Commission shall be considered by the Commission at its next available meeting. Any such referral shall be only for the purpose of issue clarification

--- Chunk 1549 ---
and advice. In all cases, the City Council shall retain jurisdiction and, after receiving the advice of the Planning Commission, shall hold a hearing on and decide the appeal. The City Clerk shall notify the Secretary of the City Planning Commission of the date set for consideration thereof. Not less than seventeen (17) days prior thereto, written notice shall be given to: the applicant; the appellant in those cases where the applicant is not the appellant; adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as the Secretary deems appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal. During the hearing on the appeal, the appellant will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented prior to the close of the City Planning Commission's public hearing on the item, in accordance with the above procedures, as the appeal is not de novo. The appellant shall not be permitted to present any other issues and/or evidence (written, oral, or otherwise) during the appeal process. In considering the appeal, the Council shall determine whether the proposal conforms

--- Chunk 1550 ---
to the applicable design review criteria, and may approve or disapprove the proposal or require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to ensure conformity to said criteria. The decision of the City Council shall be made by resolution and shall be final. --- Page 864 --- OAKLAND 864 17.136.100 Adherence to approved plans. A. A design review approval shall be subject to the plans and other conditions upon the basis of which it was granted. Except as indicated in Subsection B. below or unless a different termination date is prescribed, the approval shall terminate three (3) years from the effective date of its granting unless, within such period, all necessary permits for construction, alteration, demolition, or removal, as the case may be, have been filed with the Planning and Building Department and diligently pursued towards completion. Upon written request and payment of appropriate fees submitted no later than the expiration date of this approval, the Zoning Manager, or his or her designee, may grant up to a two-year extension of this date, with additional extensions subject to approval by the original reviewing officer or body. Expiration of any necessary building

--- Chunk 1559 ---
delivery to all persons shown on the last available equalized assessment roll as owning real property within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; --- Page 868 --- OAKLAND 868 provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown in such records shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. If, however, the conditions as set forth in Section 17.130.020 apply, alternative notification procedures discussed therein may replace or supplement these procedures. The Commission shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the criterion set forth in Section 17.138.050, and may recommend approval or disapproval of the application, or recommend its approval subject to changes in the development agreement or conditions of approval, giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section 17.138.060. Should a decision not be rendered within sixty (60) days after the filing, the application shall be deemed approved except when, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, an environmental document is required prior to decision, in which case should a decision not be rendered within sixty (60) days

--- Chunk 1560 ---
after final action on the environmental document, the application shall be deemed approved. In any case, however, the date by which a decision must be rendered may be extended by agreement between the Director of City Planning or the City Planning Commission and the applicant. The Commission shall, within ten days of its decision, forward its recommendations to the City Council. (Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: prior planning code § 9352) 17.138.040 Council action. After a recommendation has been rendered by the Commission, the City Council shall set the date for consideration of the matter. After setting the hearing date, the Council, prior to hearing the appeal, may refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further consideration and advice. Appeals referred to the Planning Commission shall be considered by the Commission at its next available meeting. Any such referral shall be only for the purpose of issue clarification and advice. In all cases, the City Council shall retain jurisdiction and, after receiving the advice of the Planning Commission, shall hold a hearing on and decide the appeal. The City Clerk shall notify the Secretary of the City Planning Commission of the date set for consideration

--- Chunk 1561 ---
thereof. Notice of the hearing shall be given by mail or delivery to the applicant, to all parties who have commented on the initial application, and to other interested parties as deemed appropriate. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. The Council shall review the recommendation of the Commission and shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the criterion set forth in Section 17.138.050, and may approve or disapprove the proposed development agreement, or approve it subject to changes therein or conditions of approval, giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section 17.138.060. If the Council approves the development agreement or approves it subject to changes or conditions, it shall do so by ordinance and the agreement shall be effective upon the effective date of the ordinance. In any case, the decision of the Council shall be final. (Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: prior planning code § 9353) 17.138.050 Criterion. A development agreement may be approved only if it is found that the proposal is consistent with the Oakland General Plan and with any applicable district plan or development control map which has

--- Chunk 1562 ---
been adopted by the City Council, as said plans or map currently exist. (Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; prior planning code § 9354) --- Page 869 --- OAKLAND 869 17.138.060 Factors for consideration. In reviewing an application for a development agreement, the City Planning Commission and the City Council shall give consideration to the status and adequacy of pertinent plans; any uncertainty or issues about the affected area which may suggest the retention of flexibility; the traffic, parking, public service, visual, and other impacts of the proposed development project upon abutting properties and the surrounding area; the provisions included, if any, for reservation, dedication, or improvement of land for public purposes or accessible to the public; the type and magnitude of the project's economic benefits to Oakland, and of its contribution if any toward a meeting of housing needs; and to any other comparable, relevant factor. (Prior planning code § 9355) 17.138.070 Recordation. Within ten (10) days after the effective date of the development agreement, the City Clerk shall record with the County Recorder a copy of the agreement. If the agreement is amended, canceled, or revoked pursuant to Section 17.138.080 or 17.138.090, the City Clerk shall record

--- Chunk 1563 ---
notice of such action with the recorder. (Prior planning code § 9356) 17.138.080 Adherence to development agreement, and amendment or cancellation by mutual consent. A subsisting development agreement shall be enforceable by any party thereto. The interests of the applicant may not be transferred or assigned to a new person without the written consent of the city. In any case, the burdens of such agreement shall also bind, and its benefits shall also inure to, all successors in interest. A development agreement may be amended, or canceled in whole or in part, by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or their successors in interest. Such amendments and cancellations shall be processed in the same manner as an original application and shall be subject to the same procedural requirements. (Prior planning code § 9357) 17.138.090 Periodic review. Each development agreement shall be reviewed at least once every twelve (12) months, and the review period shall be specified in the agreement. Application for periodic review shall be made on a form prescribed by the City Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such department. The application shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in the city master fee

--- Chunk 1564 ---
schedule. Failure to file for such review within the time limits specified in the agreement shall render the agreement null and void. The applicant or successor in interest shall be required to demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. If the Director of City Planning finds that such compliance has been deficient, he or she shall forward this finding and his or her recommendation to the City Council, for consideration in accordance with the enforcement procedure in Chapter 17.152.

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Planned Unit Development Procedure. The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe the procedure for the review of Planned Unit Developments and to encourage those which are appropriately designed and located. This procedure shall apply to all proposed developments for which a permit is required by Section 17.142.030. Whenever such a development is subject to the real estate subdivision regulations, this procedure shall be complied with, and, in addition thereto, such regulations. (Ord. 12872 § 4 (part), 2008; prior planning code § 9400) 17.140.020 Application. Application for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit shall be made by the owner of the affected property or his or her authorized agent, or by another party described in Section 17.142.040, on a form prescribed by the City Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such Department. The application shall be accompanied by the fee

--- Chunk 1566 ---
prescribed in the fee schedule in Chapter 17.150, and by the following: A. A preliminary development plan of the entire development showing streets, driveways, sidewalks and pedestrian ways, and off-street parking and loading areas; location and approximate dimensions of structures; utilization of structures, including activities and the number of living units; estimated population; reservations for public uses, including schools, parks, playgrounds, and other open spaces; major landscaping features; relevant operational data; and drawings and elevations clearly establishing the scale, character, and relationship of buildings, streets, and open spaces. Such development plan shall include maps and information on the surrounding area within one hundred (100) feet of the development. All elements listed in this paragraph shall be characterized --- Page 872 --- OAKLAND 872 as existing or proposed, and sufficiently detailed to indicate intent and impact. In the case of a development intended to be constructed over a period of more than four (4) years, the design and arrangement of those portions of the project to be constructed more than four (4) years in the future may be shown in generalized, schematic fashion; B.

An application for a Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit shall be considered by the City Planning Commission which shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be given by posting an enlarged notice on the premises of the subject property. Notice of the hearing shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the

--- Chunk 1568 ---
affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. If, however, the conditions as set forth in Section 17.130.020 apply, alternative notification procedures discussed therein may replace or supplement these procedures. While the hearing is open, any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence to the Commission for its consideration; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Commission shall determine whether the proposal conforms to the permit criteria set forth in Section 17.140.080 and to the Planned Unit Development regulations in Chapter 17.142, and may approve or disapprove the application and the accompanying preliminary development plan or require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations and ensure conformity to said criteria. In so doing, the Commission may, in its discretion, authorize submission of the final development plan in stages corresponding to different units or elements of the development. It may do so only upon evidence assuring

--- Chunk 1569 ---
completion of the entire development in accordance with the preliminary development plan and stage development schedule. The determination of the Commission shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.140.070. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, in accordance with the above procedures.

mentioned in Section 17.106.010.B; 4. Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR), except for One-Family Dwellings and Two- to Four- Family Dwellings; 5. Maximum size of Commercial or Industrial establishments. --- Page 892 --- OAKLAND 892 B. Minor Variance. A "Minor Variance" is the relaxation of a specific requirement in the zoning regulations which does not involve any of the provisions listed in Subsection A. of this Section and exceeds the allowance for minor zoning exceptions in Subsection C. of this Section. C. Minor Zoning Exception. A "Minor Zoning Exception" is the relaxation of a specific requirement in the zoning regulations which does not result in more than a ten percent (10%) deviation from an applicable numeric zoning standard or involve any of the provisions listed in Subsection A. of this Section. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 12237 § 4 (part), 2000: Ord. 12138 § 4 (part), 1999; prior planning code § 9601) 17.148.030 Application. In all zones, application for a variance or minor zoning exception shall be made by the owner of the affected property, or his or her authorized agent, on a

--- Chunk 1610 ---
form prescribed by the Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such Department. The application shall be accompanied by such information, including but not limited to, site and building plans, drawings and elevations, and operational data, as may be required to permit the review of the proposal in the context of the required findings, and by the fee prescribed in the fee schedule in Chapter 17.150. (Ord. 12376 § 3 (part), 2001: prior planning code § 9602) 17.148.040 Procedure for consideration. A. Major Variances. 1. In All Zones. An application for a Major Variance shall be considered by the City Planning Commission which shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of the hearing shall be given by posting an enlarged notice on the premises of the subject property involved in the application. Notice of the hearing shall also be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property in the City within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings.

--- Chunk 1611 ---
All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing. While the hearing is open, any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence to the Commission for its consideration; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Commission shall determine whether the conditions required in Section 17.148.050 are present, and may grant or deny an application for a variance or require such changes in the proposed use or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in its judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations. The decision of the Commission shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.148.070. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, in accordance with the above procedures. In the event the last --- Page 893 --- OAKLAND 893 date of appeal falls

--- Chunk 1612 ---
on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. 2. Alcoholic Beverage Sales Commercial Activities. In addition to following the provisions of Subsection A.1. of this Section, the City Planning Commission shall also determine whether the proposal conforms to the criteria for findings of "Public Convenience and Necessity" set forth in Subsection 17.103.030.B.3. B. Minor Variances. 1. In All Zones. An application for a Minor Variance shall be considered by the Director of City Planning. However, the Director may, at his or her discretion, refer the application to the City Planning Commission rather than acting on it himself or herself. In this case, the application shall still be considered a minor permit, but shall be processed according to the procedure in Subsection A. of this Section. In these instances, any other minor permits associated with the application shall be considered concurrently by the Planning Commission, pursuant to Section 17.130.090. At his or her discretion, an administrative hearing may be held. Notice shall be given by posting an enlarged notice on the premises of the subject property involved in the application; notice shall also

--- Chunk 1613 ---
be given by mail or delivery to all owners and occupants of real property in the City within three hundred (300) feet of the property involved; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown on the last available equalized assessment roll shall not invalidate the affected proceedings. All such notices shall be given not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date set for the hearing, if such is to be held, or, if not, for decision on the application by the Director. Any interested party must enter into the record any issues and/or oral, written, and/or documentary evidence: (a) to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period for his or her consideration, or (b) to the Commission while the hearing is open for its consideration, whichever is applicable; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal hearing and/or in court. The Director shall determine whether the conditions required in Section 17.148.050 are present, and may grant or deny the application for a variance or require such changes in the proposed use or impose

--- Chunk 1614 ---
such reasonable conditions of approval as are in his or her judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations. The decision of the Director of City Planning shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Planning Commission in accordance with Section 17.148.060. In those cases which are referred to the Commission by the Director, the decision of the Commission shall become final ten (10) days after the date of decision unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 17.148.070. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues and/or evidence presented (a) to the Director prior to the close of the written public comment period, or (b) to the Commission prior to the close of the Commission's public hearing on the matter, whichever is applicable, in accordance with the above procedures. In the event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. C. Minor Zoning Exceptions. 1. In All Zones. An application for a Minor Zoning Exception shall be

--- Chunk 1615 ---
considered by the Zoning Manager, or his or her designee. The Zoning Manager, or his or her designee, shall determine whether the proposal meets the requirements for a Minor Zoning Exception as set forth in this Chapter. At the time of Minor Zoning Exception application, --- Page 894 --- OAKLAND 894 the owner of the affected property, or his or her authorized agent, shall obtain from the Planning and Building Department, a notice poster to install on the project site; and a Notice to Neighboring Properties form which includes the project description and contact information. Prior to the subject application being deemed complete, the applicant shall install the notice poster provided at the time of application at a location on the project site that is clearly visible from the street, alley, or private way providing access to the subject lot; and provide by mail or delivery a copy of the completed project notice form, as well as a set of reduced plans (consisting of at least a site plan and building elevations that show all proposed exterior work) to all owners and occupants of the City of Oakland lot or lots adjacent to the project site and directly across the

--- Chunk 1616 ---
street abutting the project site. All required posting of the site and notification of adjacent and across the street property owners and occupants shall be completed by the project applicant not less than ten (10) days prior to the earliest date for final decision on the application. During the required noticing period, the Planning and Building Department shall receive and consider comments from any interested party. The Zoning Manager, or his or her designee, may approve or disapprove a Minor Zoning Exception proposal and may require such changes therein or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are in his or her judgment necessary to carry out the purposes of the zoning regulations. The decision by the Zoning Manager, or his or her designee, shall be final immediately and not appealable. D. Alternative Notification Procedures. If the conditions as set forth in Section 17.130.020 apply, alternative notification procedures discussed therein may replace or supplement the procedures set forth in Subsections A. and B. of this Section. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. No. 13064, § 2(Exh. A), 3-15-2011; Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 12376 § 3 (part), 2001: Ord. 12237 § 4 (part), 2000;

--- Chunk 1617 ---
Ord. 11831 § 6, 1995; prior planning code § 9603) 17.148.050 Findings required. A. With the exception of variances for Adult Entertainment Activities or Sign Facilities, a variance may be granted only upon determination that all of the following conditions are present: 1. That strict compliance with the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations, due to unique physical or topographic circumstances or conditions of design; or, as an alternative in the case of a minor variance, that such strict compliance would preclude an effective design solution improving livability, operational efficiency, or appearance. 2. That strict compliance with the regulations would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by owners and occupants of similarly zoned property; or, as an alternative in the case of a Minor Variance, that such strict compliance would preclude an effective design solution fulfilling the basic intent of the applicable regulation. 3. That the variance, if granted, will not adversely affect the character, livability, or appropriate development of abutting properties or the surrounding area, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or contrary to adopted plans or development policy. 4. That the variance will

--- Chunk 1618 ---
not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on similarly zoned properties or inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations. 5. That the elements of the proposal requiring the variance (e.g., elements such as buildings, walls, fences, driveways, garages and carports, etc.) conform with the design review criteria set forth in the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136. --- Page 895 --- OAKLAND 895 6. That the proposal conforms in all significant respects with the Oakland General Plan and with any other applicable guidelines or criteria, district plan, or development control map which have been adopted by the Planning Commission or City Council. 7. For proposals involving One-Family Residential Facilities on a lot: That, if the variance would relax a regulation governing maximum height, minimum yards, maximum lot coverage or maximum floor area ratio, the proposal also conforms with at least one of the following additional criteria: a. The proposal when viewed in its entirety will not adversely impact abutting residences to the side, rear, or directly across the street with respect to solar access, view blockage and privacy to a degree greater than that which would be possible if the residence were built according to

--- Chunk 1619 ---
the applicable regulation and, for height variances, the proposal provides detailing, articulation or other design treatments that mitigate any bulk created by the additional height; or b. Over sixty percent (60%) of the lots in the immediate vicinity are already developed and the proposal does not exceed the corresponding as-built condition on these lots and, for height variances, the proposal provides detailing, articulation or other design treatments that mitigate any bulk created by the additional height. The immediate context shall consist of the five (5) closest lots on each side of the project site plus the ten (10) closest lots on the opposite side of the street (see illustration I-4b); however, the Director of City Planning may make an alternative determination of immediate context based on specific site conditions. Such determination shall be in writing and included as part of any decision on any variance. B. A variance for Adult Entertainment Activities shall be granted upon a determination that all of the following conditions are present, notwithstanding any conflicting requirements contained elsewhere in the zoning regulations: 1. That strict compliance with the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations,

--- Chunk 1620 ---
due to unique physical or topographic circumstance or conditions of design; 2. That strict compliance with the regulations would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by owners and occupants of similarly zoned property; 3. That the variance will not adversely affect the use of churches, temples or synagogues; public, parochial or private elementary, junior high or high schools; public parks and recreation centers; public or parochial playgrounds; residences; child care facilities; elderly residential care facilities; hospitals; medical clinics; colleges; or libraries, all within a five hundred (500) foot radius by engendering sounds, activities, visual depictions or advertisements that create an exterior atmosphere which unreasonably interferes with the operations of such surrounding uses; 4. That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on similarly zoned properties or inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations. C. A variance for Sign Facilities shall be granted upon a determination that all of the following conditions are present, notwithstanding any conflicting requirements contained elsewhere in the zoning regulations: 1. That strict compliance with the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations, due to unique physical or

--- Chunk 1621 ---
topographic circumstance or conditions of design; --- Page 896 --- OAKLAND 896 2. That strict compliance with the regulations would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by owners and occupants of similarly zoned property; and 3. That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on similarly zoned properties or inconsistent with the purposes of the zoning regulations. D. A Minor Zoning Exception shall be granted upon a determination that: 1. The elements of the proposal requiring the Minor Zoning Exception (e.g., elements such as buildings, walls, fences, driveways, garages, carports, etc.) conform with the applicable design review criteria set forth in the design review procedure in Chapter 17.136; and 2. For proposals involving One-Family Residential Facilities, the Minor Zoning Exception when viewed in its entirety would not adversely impact abutting properties to the side, rear, or directly across the street with respect to solar access, view blockage and privacy to a degree greater than that which would be possible if the proposal were built according to the applicable regulation.

In the case of appeals involving One-Family or Two- to Four-Family Residential Facilities, the appeal shall be considered by the Commission's Residential Appeals Committee. In the event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or holiday when City offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal. Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the Planning and Building Department and shall be filed with such Department, along with the appropriate fees required by the City's Master Fee Schedule. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the Director or wherein his or her decision is not supported by the evidence in the record.

raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, previously presented to the Director of City Planning prior to the close of the written public comment period on the item, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues and/or evidence during the appeal and/or in court. The appeal is not de novo. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Secretary of the City Planning Commission shall set the date for consideration thereof. Not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the date of the Commission's or Committee's consideration of the appeal, written notice shall be given to: the applicant; the appellant in those cases where the applicant is not the appellant; adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as the Secretary deems appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal.

Except as indicated in Subsection B. below or unless a different termination date is prescribed, the permit shall terminate three (3) years from the effective date of its granting unless, within such period, all necessary permits for construction or alteration have been filed with the Planning and Building Department and diligently pursued towards completion, or the authorized activities have commenced in the case of a variance not involving construction or alteration. Upon written request and payment of appropriate fees submitted no later than the expiration

--- Chunk 1631 ---
date of this approval, the Zoning Manager, or his or her designee, may grant up to a two-year extension of this date, with additional extensions subject to approval by the original reviewing officer or body. Expiration of any necessary building permit for the project may invalidate the variance approval if said approval or extension period has also expired.

This Section shall not apply in instances where the applicant can show, on the face of any subsequent application, changed circumstances sufficient to justify a rehearing. Applications for hearing pursuant to this Section shall be considered by the Director of City Planning. A decision by the Director shall become final ten (10) calendar days after the date of

For purposes of this Section, the personal obligation requirement shall apply to individuals and entities. The Building Official shall give the permit holder and owner of such premises a written notice showing the amount of the penalty, fine and expense and requesting payment thereof. If the amount of such penalty, time and expense are not paid to the Building Official within five (5) days after the date of such notice, the Building Official shall forward a report of the penalty, fine and expense to the City Planning Commission for a confirmation hearing.

The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Demolition, Conversion and Rehabilitation Regulations for Residential Hotels. B. Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to benefit the general public by minimizing the adverse impact on the housing supply and on displaced very low and extremely low income, elderly, and disabled persons, which results from the loss of Residential Hotel Units as a naturally occurring affordable housing option. This is to be accomplished by establishing a process for identifying and preparing a registry of known existing Residential Hotel Units, and by regulating the demolition, conversion and rehabilitation of Residential Hotel Units. C. Findings. The City Council finds that: 1. The City of Oakland is experiencing a severe housing affordability crisis that requires immediate emergency action by the City government. 2. Residential Hotels are often housing of last resort for the poor, especially in areas with extremely high costs of housing such as Oakland. 3. The housing affordability crisis continues to overwhelm Oakland residents and threatens the public health, safety and/or welfare of our citizenry. 4. A number of economic forces, including the dearth of hotels

--- Chunk 1662 ---
and the high cost of new construction in Oakland, create incentives for developers to purchase Residential Hotels and repurpose them for non-residential uses, such as boutique hotels, or reconfigure them for other residential uses that result in the displacement of existing tenants or the removal of rental units from the market. 5. The loss of Residential Hotels in Oakland would exacerbate the already overwhelming burden on public and non-profit agencies that provide protective, social, health, psychological, nutritional, and other important and necessary services to the tenant population of such hotels. --- Page 913 --- OAKLAND 913 6. The City Council has determined that Residential Hotels are an essential component of the City's supply of Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing (NOAH) as they are a flexible and easily accessible form of housing that provides very low, and extremely low-income residents the ability to remain in Oakland and to avoid homelessness. 7. The City of Oakland Housing and Community Development Department prepared a report in September of 2015 which states that from 1985 through 2015, the City lost approximately 799 Residential Hotel units in Downtown Oakland, and many more units are at-risk of being lost or are already lost to the supply of

--- Chunk 1663 ---
NOAH units. 8. The California State Legislature has recognized the need for retaining Residential Hotels to provide housing for low, very low, and extremely low-income individuals in legislation, and in justifying such legislation: The Legislature finds and declares that the need for decent housing among individuals of very low and low income is great, and that residential hotels are often the only form of housing affordable to these individuals. Many residential hotels are in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation, and many are being demolished or converted to other uses. California Health and Safety Code § 50519(a) 9. The unrestricted demolition, conversion or rehabilitation of Residential Hotels exacerbates the housing crisis by making such units unaffordable to low, very low, and extremely low-income Oakland residents, and may result in the displacement of Oakland residents from their homes and communities. 10. Based on the previous findings, the City finds that there is a current and immediate threat to the public health, safety, and/or welfare associated with the Demolition, Conversion and Rehabilitation of Residential Hotels. 11. It is in the public interest that the conversion, demolition and amenity rehabilitation of residential hotel units be regulated and mitigated. Furthermore, in order to

--- Chunk 1664 ---
protect the resident tenants and to conserve limited housing resources, remedies must be provided where conversion or demolition occurs. 12. Projects that transform an existing Residential Hotel or rebuild Residential Hotel Units as new deed-restricted affordable housing would provide stable housing for the populations most severely impacted by the loss of Residential Hotel units, and serve an over-riding public benefit, as long as they minimize unit loss and are deed-restricted to extremely low and very low income households. 13. Residential Hotel buildings that have been continuously vacant for 10 years or more may constitute a public health and safety hazard; and may require additional amenities in order to bring those Residential Hotel units back into the housing stock. 17.153.020 Definitions The following terms, whenever used in this Chapter, shall be construed as defined herein.

Official to be necessary to meet life safety standards, provided that (1) it involves the minimum amount of Demolition necessary to meet life safety standards; and (2) the condition of the Residential Hotel or Residential Hotel Unit, which necessitates the life safety upgrades, was not caused by any voluntary action of the owner of said facility; or F. A proposed project that will involve Demolition or Conversion of existing Residential Hotel Units and create or retain at the property a number of units equal to the number of Residential Hotel units in the existing property as Affordable Housing and complies with the following additional criteria below.

Waiver determinations may be granted by the Director to the restrictions set forth in Section 17.153.040 or the Conditional Use Permit requirements set forth in Section 17.153.050 on the following grounds: 1. The requirements of this Chapter have been incorrectly applied; or 2. Application of the requirements of this Chapter is unlawful under and/or conflict with federal, state, or local law and/or regulation, including constituting an unlawful taking of property without just compensation. --- Page 920 --- OAKLAND 920 B. Applications for waiver determinations. Applications for waiver determinations must be made no later than the date of application for a building or planning permit on a form provided by the

--- Chunk 1683 ---
City, and shall include payment of fees as established in the Master Fee Schedule. The Applicant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the applicability and elements of this Section. The Applicant must submit full information in support of their submittal as requested by the Director. Failure to raise each and every issue that is contested in the application and provide appropriate supporting evidence will be grounds to deny the application and will also preclude the Applicant from raising such issues in court. Failure to submit such an application shall preclude such person from challenging the Residential Hotel regulations in court. The Director may require, at the expense of the Applicant, review of the submitted materials by a third party. C. The Director shall mail the Applicant a written determination on the application for a waiver. D. If an applicant for a waiver determination set forth in Section 17.153.070(A) that has been denied seeks to challenge the written determination of the Director, the Appellant must appeal to the City Planning Commission, and such appeal must be filed within ten (10) calendar days of the date from which the Director's written determination was issued and by 4:00

p.m. Appeals must be on the form provided by the City of Oakland and must state specifically wherein it is claimed there was error or abuse of discretion by the Director or wherein the decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and must include payment in accordance with the City of Oakland Master Fee Schedule. Failure to make a timely appeal will preclude an Appellant from challenging the City's decision in court. The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all arguments and evidence in the record which supports the basis for the appeal. Failure to do so will preclude an Appellant from raising such issues during the appeal and/or in court. 17.153.080 Sale of Residential Hotel.

lot, or of a portion or combination of such lot or lots, may at his or her option assume that all of the regulations applying in any zone covering fifty percent (50%) or more of the lot area apply to the entire lot or lots. However, this option shall not apply unless the entire lot or all such lots or parcel of land could be included in --- Page 924 --- OAKLAND 924 such zone by shifting the affected zone boundary by not more than thirty (30) feet, as measured perpendicularly to said boundary at any point. B. Application of Regulations Where Subsection A. is Inoperative. Wherever the provisions of Subsection A. of this Section do not apply or the option provided therein is not exercised: 1. No activity type or facility type is allowed on any portion of the lot located in a zone where such type is not generally allowed, except for the accessory uses allowed by Subsections B.2. and B.3. of this Section. 2. Accessory off-street parking and loading may be located on the lot without regard for zone boundaries; provided that no parking or loading shall be located on any portion of the lot located in

--- Chunk 1691 ---
a zone where the principal activity served is not generally allowed, except as such parking is specifically allowed by the applicable individual zone regulations subject to the conditions set forth in Section 17.116.075; and further provided that parking and loading shall be subject to a conditional use permit requirement or other special controls on any portion of the lot located in any zone where such controls generally apply to parking or loading. The total amount of required parking and loading shall be calculated separately on the basis of the amount of the served use and the requirements applying in each zone; provided that the minimum size for which any parking or loading is required shall be deemed to be exceeded if it is exceeded by the total of such use on the entire lot. 3. Accessory landscaping, fences, screening or retaining walls, and usable open space may be located on the lot without regard for zone boundaries. The total amount of required usable open space shall be calculated separately on the basis of the number of living units, or amount of floor area, and the usable open space requirements in each zone; provided that where reference is made to the

--- Chunk 1692 ---
total number of living units on a lot, the number on the entire lot shall be considered. 4. The maximum permitted or conditionally permitted number of living units or Floor- Area Ratio, if any, on the lot shall be calculated separately on the basis of the amount of lot area and the density ratio and Floor-Area Ratio applying in each zone. The resulting maximum permitted or conditionally permitted total number of living units or amount of floor area may be distributed on the lot without regard for zone boundaries, except as otherwise provided in Subsection B.1. of this Section and except that the number of living units and amount of floor area within each zone shall not exceed the number or amount which would be allowed on the entire lot if it were completely within such zone. 5. The minimum lot area, width, and frontage requirements of the zone which covers the greater or greatest portion of the lot area of the lot shall apply to the entire lot. If the lot area is divided equally between two (2) or more zones, the owner or developer of the lot may assume that the minimum lot area, width, and frontage requirements

--- Chunk 1693 ---
of either or any of such zones apply to the entire lot. 6. All regulations not covered above shall apply separately to the portion of the lot within each zone, provided that where reference is made in such regulation to the total quantity of living units or other unit of measurement on a lot, the quantity on the entire lot shall be considered. C. Wherever a lot is divided by a boundary between height areas, the height area line may be moved up to thirty (30) feet in any direction upon the granting of Regular Design Review approval (see Chapter 17.136 for the Regular Design Review process) to --- Page 925 --- OAKLAND 925 accommodate the site plan of a proposed development project. In addition to the general Design Review Criteria contained in Chapter 17.136, the proposal must meet the following additional criteria: 1. The height area line adjustment creates a more successful site plan in terms of open space, parking, or building location; and 2. Appropriate height transitions are incorporated into the building design and site plan to adjacent lower density residential properties that either share a parcel line or are across the street from the proposal.

The City of Oakland recognizes that, historically, the extraction of minerals has benefited the economic well-being of the City and the needs of society and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety. The City also recognizes that surface mining within the City occurs in a diverse, established, urban environment, which presents unique health, safety and welfare issues and where geologic, topographic, climatic, biological, and other conditions are significantly different than in less urbanized areas. Therefore, reclamation operations and the applicable specifications, inspections, reporting, monitoring must be appropriate to the surrounding conditions. The purpose and intent of this Section is to

--- Chunk 1695 ---
regulate surface mining operations as required by California's Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code Sections 2710 et seq.), as amended, hereinafter referred to as "SMARA", Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 2207 (relating to annual reporting requirements), and State Mining and Geology Board regulations (hereinafter referred to as "State regulations") for surface mining and reclamation practice (California Code of Regulations [CCR], Title 14, Division 2, Chapter 8, Subchapter 1, Sections 3500 et seq.), to ensure that: --- Page 927 --- OAKLAND 927 A. Reclamation activities eliminate hazards to public health and safety and restore mined lands to a standard that is safe, stable, and usable for development of reuses that will enhance the community; B. Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized in accordance with CEQA and other applicable requirements; C. Reclamation activities further adopted City goals, plans, policies, objectives and regulations, including, without limitation the City's General Plan; D. Reclamation activities appropriately consider values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh.

In addition to any findings required by the Approved Plan or for surface mining operations, a finding shall be included that the project complies with the provisions of SMARA and State regulations. B. Reclamation Plans. For Reclamation Plans, the following findings shall be required: 1. That the Reclamation Plan complies with SMARA Sections 2772 and 2773, and any other applicable provisions; 2. That the Reclamation Plan complies with applicable requirements of State regulations (CCR § 3500-3505, and § 3700-3713). 3. That the Reclamation Plan and potential use of reclaimed land pursuant to the plan are consistent with this Section, the City's General Plan and any applicable resource plan, element or an Approved Plan. 4. That the Reclamation Plan has been reviewed pursuant to CEQA and the City's environmental review guidelines, and all significant adverse impacts from reclamation of the surface mining operations are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible. 5. That the land and/or resources such as water bodies to be reclaimed will be restored to a condition that is compatible

--- Chunk 1712 ---
with, and blends in with, the surrounding natural environment, topography, and other resources, or that suitable off-site development will compensate for related disturbance to resource values. 6. That the Reclamation Plan will restore the mined lands to a safe, stable and usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses consistent with the General Plan, and other City Approved Plans, policies, ordinances and regulations. 7. That a written response to the State Department of Conservation has been prepared, describing the disposition of major issues raised by that department. Where the City's position is at variance with the recommendations and objections raised by the State Department of Conservation, said response shall address, in detail, why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013) 17.155.100 Financial assurances. A. To ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved Reclamation Plan, the City shall require as a condition of approval security which will be released upon satisfactory performance. The applicant may pose security in the form of a surety bond, trust fund, irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial institution, or other method acceptable to the City and the State Mining and Geology Board

--- Chunk 1713 ---
as specified in State regulations, and which the City determines are adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the surface mining operation's approved Reclamation Plan and/or an Approved Plan. Financial assurances shall be made payable to City and the State Department of Conservation. B. Financial assurances will be required to ensure compliance with elements of the Reclamation Plan, including but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements, restoration of --- Page 934 --- OAKLAND 934 aquatic or wildlife habitat, restoration of water bodies and water quality, slope stability and erosion and drainage control, disposal of hazardous materials, and other measures, if determined necessary by the Planning and Building Department to comply with the requirements of an Approved Plan. C. Cost estimates for the financial assurance shall be submitted to the Planning and Building Department for review and approval prior to the operator securing financial assurances. The Planning Director shall forward a copy of the cost estimates, together with any documentation received supporting the amount of the cost estimates, to the State Department of Conservation for review. If the State Department of Conservation does not comment within forty-five (45) days of receipt of these estimates, it shall be assumed that the

--- Chunk 1714 ---
cost estimates are adequate, unless the City has reason to determine that additional costs may be incurred. The Planning Director shall have the discretion to approve the financial assurance if it meets the requirements of this Chapter, SMARA, State regulations and any requirements of an Approved Plan. D. The amount of the financial assurance shall be based upon the estimated costs of reclamation to a safe, stable and usable condition in accordance with an Approved Plan for the years or phases stipulated in the approved Reclamation Plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas as may be required, subject to adjustment for the actual amount required to reclaim lands disturbed by surface mining activities since January 1, 1976, and new lands to be disturbed in the upcoming year. Cost estimates should be prepared by a California registered Professional Engineer and/or other similarly licensed and qualified professionals retained by the operator and approved by the Planning Director. The estimated amount of the financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities necessary to implement the approved Reclamation Plan in accordance with an Approved Plan for the site, the unit costs for each of these activities, the number of units of

--- Chunk 1715 ---
each of these activities, and the actual administrative costs. Financial assurances to ensure Reclamation Plan implementation and compliance with revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, and any other applicable element of the approved Reclamation Plan shall be based upon cost estimates that include, but may not be limited to, labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration, monitoring, inspections and reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee. A contingency factor of ten percent (10%) shall be added to the cost of financial assurances. E. In projecting the costs of financial assurances, it shall be assumed without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the City or State Department of Conservation may need to contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site. F. The financial assurances shall remain in effect for the duration of the surface mining operation and any additional period until reclamation is completed (including any maintenance required). G. The amount of financial assurances required of a surface mining operation for any one year shall be adjusted annually to account for new lands disturbed by surface mining operations, inflation,

--- Chunk 1716 ---
and reclamation of lands accomplished in accordance with the approved Reclamation Plan. The financial assurances shall include estimates to cover reclamation for existing conditions and anticipated activities during the upcoming year, excepting that the permittee may not claim credit for reclamation scheduled for completion during the coming year. H. Revisions to financial assurances shall be submitted to the Planning Director each year prior to the anniversary date for approval of the financial assurances. The financial assurance shall --- Page 935 --- OAKLAND 935 cover the cost of existing disturbance and anticipated activities for the next calendar year, including any required interim reclamation. If revisions to the financial assurances are not required, the operator shall explain, in writing, why revisions are not required. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013) 17.155.110 Interim management plans. A. Within ninety (90) days of a surface mining operation becoming idle, the operator shall submit to the Planning and Building Department a proposed Interim Management Plan (IMP). The proposed IMP shall fully comply with the requirements of SMARA, including but not limited to all Approved Plan conditions, and shall provide measures the operator will implement to maintain the site in a stable condition, taking into consideration

--- Chunk 1717 ---
public health and safety. The proposed IMP shall be submitted on forms provided by the Planning and Building Department, and shall be processed as an amendment to the Reclamation Plan. IMPs shall not be considered a project for the purposes of environmental review. B. Financial assurances for idle operations shall be maintained as though the operation were active, or as otherwise approved through the idle mine's IMP. C. Upon receipt of a complete proposed IMP, the Planning and Building Department shall forward the IMP to the State Department of Conservation for review. The IMP shall be submitted to the State Department of Conservation at least thirty (30) days prior to approval by the Planning Director. D. Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the proposed IMP, or a longer period mutually agreed upon by the Planning Director and the operator, the Planning Director shall review and approve or deny the IMP in accordance with this Chapter. The operator shall have thirty (30) days, or a longer period mutually agreed upon by the operator and the Planning Director, to submit a revised IMP. The Planning Director shall approve or deny the revised IMP within sixty (60) days of receipt. If the

--- Chunk 1718 ---

The provisions of this part shall be known as the California Environmental Quality Act procedures, and may be referred to as the city CEQA procedures. The purpose of these provisions is to provide a basis for implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by the city as directed by Section 15022 et seq. of the State CEQA Guidelines. These provisions shall apply to all projects sponsored by the city or Redevelopment Agency, and to all private projects requiring any discretionary approvals from the city. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1100) 17.158.150 Policy. CEQA obliges every public agency

--- Chunk 1780 ---
and every citizen to take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environment of California. Major consideration shall be given by the city to prevent environmental damage, both in making decisions on city projects and in regulating the activities of private individuals and corporations. The Oakland Policy Plan, a component of the Oakland Comprehensive Plan, contains three goals that relate to the purpose of these procedures: (1) To protect and improve Oakland's physical environment; (2) To conserve with care the open space and natural resources which will be needed by present and future generations; and (3) To recognize natural environmental hazards in planning for the city's future development. It is the policy of the city that consideration of environmental effects shall be incorporated into project conceptualization, design and planning at the earliest feasible time. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1110) 17.158.160 State CEQA Guidelines.

A (part), 2006: Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1150) 17.158.200 Decision on projects. The City Planning Commission or other appropriate decision-making body shall not approve a project for which the environmental review process is required without following the procedures outlined below. A. Exempt Projects. If the project is exempt, some finding to this effect shall be included in the record. If action is by resolution, the resolution will typically contain a clause declaring that the project is exempt from the requirements of CEQA. B. Negative Declarations. If a negative declaration has been prepared, the decision-making body shall review this document and approve the negative declaration concurrently in approving the project's discretionary permit application. After making a decision, the decision-making body or its agent shall notify the Environmental Review Officer, to cause a Notice of Determination (NOD) to be filed with the County Clerk. If the project requires discretionary approval from any State agency, the Environmental Review Officer shall also cause the notice of determination to be

--- Chunk 1785 ---
filed with the State Office of Planning and Research. The filing of the notice of determination is a mandatory requirement under CEQA Guidelines Section 15075. --- Page 968 --- OAKLAND 968 The NOD shall include the following information: 1. A project identification including its common name and its location; 2. A brief description of the project; 3. The date of project approval; 4. A statement of determination that the project would not have a significant effect on the environment; 5. A statement that a negative declaration or an environmental impact report has been prepared pursuant to the provisions of CEQA; 6. The address and location where a copy of the negative declaration may be examined. C. Environmental Impact Report (EIR). If an EIR has been prepared, the decision-making body shall certify the final EIR before approving the discretionary permits for the project. However, no project for which an EIR was completed and certified, and which identifies one or more significant environmental effects shall be approved without making one or more findings for each of the identified significant environmental effects. Such findings shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record. The following possible findings are identified in CEQA Guidelines Section

--- Chunk 1786 ---
15091: 1. Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which would avoid or substantially lessen the identified significant environmental effect as identified in the final EIR; 2. Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the City. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and should be adopted by such other agency; 3. Specific economic, social, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR. Should a finding be made that mitigation measures are not feasible, the decision- making body shall adopt a "statement of overriding consideration" as described in CEQA Guidelines Section 15093. 4. If the benefits of a proposed project outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects, the environmental effects may be considered acceptable. The decision-making body shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on the final EIR and/or information in the record. If a statement of overriding consideration is adopted, it should be identified in the notice of determination. After making a decision, the decision-making body or its agents shall notify the Environmental Review Officer, who shall cause a

--- Chunk 1787 ---
Notice of Determination (NOD) to be filed with the County Clerk and if required, the State Office of Planning and Research. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1160) 17.158.210 Time limits, extension or waiver of time limits. The Review Officer shall have authority to extend or waive time limits as provided in the Guidelines. Such action is appealable to the City Planning Commission within ten (10) days of --- Page 969 --- OAKLAND 969 the Review Officer's decision. The decision of the City Planning Commission is final. However, failure to adhere to the prescribed time limits, shall not in and of itself, prejudice the city from requiring appropriate environmental review. A. Review of Application for Completeness. At the time the city receives an application for a permit or other entitlement that requires discretionary review, the city will have thirty (30) days to review the application for completeness of required information for environmental determination. As noted in Section 15101 of the CEQA Guidelines, if no written determination of the completeness of the application is made within that period, the application will be deemed complete on the thirtieth day. The running

--- Chunk 1788 ---
of CEQA processing time periods should begin on the same date as the permit processing time limits. B. Initial Study. The Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative shall determine within thirty (30) days after receiving an application as complete whether the Environmental Review Officer will direct that a negative declaration or an EIR, or a previously prepared negative declaration or an EIR may serve as environmental documentation for the proposed project. The thirty (30) day time limit may be extended fifteen (15) days upon the consent of the Environmental Review Officer and the project sponsor (CEQA Guidelines Section 15102). C. Negative Declarations. The negative declaration must be completed within one hundred five (105) days from the date that the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative has determined that the application is complete. CEQA Guidelines Section 15107 states that this statutory requirement applies to private sponsored projects only. D. Notice of Preparation. Upon completion of an initial study, and it is determined that an EIR is required, a notice of preparation shall be prepared. All responsible and trustee agencies, interested individuals and organizations shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice to respond and comment on the scope of

--- Chunk 1789 ---
project environmental effects. E. Environmental Impact Report. With respect to private projects, the preparation and certification of the final EIR shall be completed within one-year of the date that an application is accepted as complete. Upon the mutual consent of both the Environmental Review Officer and the project sponsor, this one-year time limit may be extended once for a period of not more than ninety (90) days (CEQA Guidelines Section 15108). F. Projects Subject to CEQA and NEPA. If a project is subject to both CEQA and NEPA environmental processing, the one-year time limit for the preparation of an EIR, and the one hundred five (105) day time limit for a negative declaration may be waived under certain conditions as discussed in Section 15110 of the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, this time limit waiver shall apply when additional time is needed to prepare a combined EIR/EIS or combined negative declaration/FONSI, and if the time to prepare the combined documents would be shorter than the time required to prepare the documents separately. G. Statute of Limitations. As stated in Section 15112 of the CEQA Guidelines, the statute of limitations for environmental documents are as follows: (a) Notice of exemption: thirty-five (35) days

--- Chunk 1790 ---
after the filing of the notice with the County Clerk. (b) Notice of determination: thirty (30) days after filing of the notice and the posting of the notice by the County Clerk, and/or the State Office of Planning and Research. --- Page 970 --- OAKLAND 970 (c) If neither a notice of exemption nor a notice of determination has been filed with the appropriate agency, the statute of limitations shall be for one hundred eighty (180) days after the decision-making body's decision on the proposed project. The statute of limitations are not waiting periods for the project sponsor. Therefore, the project sponsor may proceed at their own risk of possible legal challenge, to carry out the project as soon as the necessary and required permits for the project have been granted by the appropriate permit-granting agencies. H. Suspension of Time Periods. As authorized by Section 15109 of the CEQA Guidelines, the Environmental Review Officer may suspend the running of the time period for the preparation of negative declarations and EIRs, if the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative determines that the project sponsor has caused an unreasonable delay in meeting requests for information or collection of required fees. In addition,

--- Chunk 1791 ---
the Planning Commission may disapprove a project application without prejudice, if there is an unreasonable delay in meeting requests for additional information or other indications of unresponsiveness that would affect the timely and expeditious preparation of the environmental documentation for the project. The Environmental Review Officer will allow the project sponsor no more than three months to respond before a recommendation may be made to the City Planning Commission to disapprove the project without prejudice. Requests for information to the project sponsor or his/her representatives shall be made in written form, and at least one written notice sent by registered mail to the project sponsor shall be sent a minimum of two weeks before the three-month time limit ends, to allow the project sponsor time to respond. The Environmental Review Officer will allow a renewed application submitted with new fees, to start at the same point where the project was suspended or disapproved without prejudice provided the project description has not been substantially altered and will not increase the adverse environmental effects of the project as compared with the project that was disapproved without prejudice. If after a one-year period after the proposed project application has been denied without prejudice,

--- Chunk 1792 ---
and the project sponsor has not taken steps to re-initiate processing of the environmental documentation for the proposed project, the environmental review file will be closed permanently. Any subsequent resurrection of the proposed project will be treated as a new project and require submittal of a new application and collection of new fees. (Ord. No. 13172, § 3(Exh. A), 7-2-2013; Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1170) 17.158.220 Appeals and challenges. The following are administrative appeals or challenges of environmental determinations made by the Environmental Review Officer, or by his or her representative. Legal challenges to the adequacy of environmental determinations are described in Section 17.158.210G. Failure to administratively appeal may limit the issues that one may raise in another administrative level or in a legal challenge in a court of law. The process governing appeals/challenges is illustrated in Figure 1. However, this text takes precedence over the figure. A. Any determination of exemption, except those made by a final decision-making body, may be appealed in writing and with the appropriate fee according to the master fee schedule to the City Planning Commission, prior to the close of the public comment period on the underlying permits/decision.

--- Chunk 1793 ---
The determination of the City Planning Commission shall be final. --- Page 971 --- OAKLAND 971 B. Initial Study. The determination of the Environmental Review Officer may be appealed by the project sponsor, in writing and with the appropriate fee as found in the master fee schedule, within twenty-one (21) days from the day the project sponsor has been notified, to the Planning Commission, whose decision shall be final. C. Negative Declaration. The negative declaration notice shall invite written challenges to the finding of no significant effect. Such written challenges shall be submitted with the appropriate challenge fee, as shown on the current master fee schedule. The challenge shall run concurrently with the twenty-one (21) or thirty (30) day public review period for the negative declaration notification. The City Planning Commission shall consider any and all such challenges, and may reject them or may direct that an appropriate environmental document be prepared (e.g., environmental exemption, mitigated negative declaration, negative declaration, or environmental impact report). The City Planning Commission's decision shall be final. D. Determination of Need For an Environmental Impact Report. The Environmental Review Officer's determination that the preparation of an EIR is necessary may be appealed by the project

--- Chunk 1794 ---
sponsor, in writing and with the appropriate fee in the master fee schedule, within twenty-one (21) days of the project sponsor's receipt of this environmental determination. The City Planning Commission shall consider such appeal and may reject or direct that an appropriate environmental document be prepared. The City Planning Commission's decision shall be final. E. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, although the environmental determination of the City Planning Commission is final, where another decision-making body must approve the project itself, that decision-making body must make an environmental determination prior to taking action on the project. F. Certification of an Environmental Impact Report. The certification of the EIR by the City Planning Commission may be appealed in writing and with the appropriate fee as found in the master fee schedule, to the City Council within ten days from the City Planning Commission decision to certify the EIR. The City Council shall retain jurisdiction to determine whether the EIR shall be certified.

The provisions of this article shall be known as the exemption process. The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe the procedure for making, appealing, and processing determinations of exemption from environmental review under CEQA. This process shall apply to all projects which are determined to be exempt from environmental review under CEQA. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1200) --- Page 973 --- OAKLAND 973 --- Page 974 --- OAKLAND 974 17.158.240 Authority to make exemption determinations. For a public project, any city body or officer may make a finding that an action is not subject to environmental review, consistent with the provisions of these procedures. The Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative, the Environmental Review Coordinator, may be requested to make or to confirm such finding by forwarding to him or her a request for determination of exemption from environmental review on a form prescribed by the City Planning Department. In evaluating a proposed activity to determine if there is no possibility that the activity may have a significant effect

--- Chunk 1796 ---
on the environment, the overall consequences of the city's discretionary action shall be considered, including direct and indirect results. For a private project, the project sponsor shall submit a request for determination of exemption from environmental review on a form prescribed by the Environmental Review Officer and the appropriate fee according to the master fee schedule. In evaluating a proposed activity to determine if there is no possibility that the activity may have a significant effect on the environment, the overall consequences of the discretionary action shall be considered, including direct and indirect results. Should the project sponsor believe that the proposed project is not an exemptible project, the project sponsor may prepare and submit a request for environmental review. The process for this step is discussed in Section 17.58.320A of these Environmental Review Regulations. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1210) 17.158.250 Appeal to City Planning Commission. Any determination of exemption except those made by a final decision-making body, may be appealed to the City Planning Commission as set forth in Section 17.158.220A. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1220) 17.158.260 Notice of exemption. Following approval of an exempt project, the

--- Chunk 1797 ---
Environmental Review officer may be responsible for preparing a notice of exemption, and may cause the notice of exemption and any pertinent fees to be filed with the County Clerk. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1230) 17.158.270 Considerations in making exemption determinations. A. Applicability to Overall Project. When determining whether a particular action or permit is exempt from environmental review, the overall project to which the action or permit is related shall be considered, and the exemption criteria shall be applied to the overall project, not the individual action or permit. If the project is determined to be exempt, all actions and permits related to it shall likewise be deemed exempt. If the project is determined not to be exempt, a single environmental review shall be performed covering all actions and permits related to the project, and none of those actions or permits shall be finalized or issued until environmental review is performed. For example, an easement abandonment for the purpose of constructing a small addition to an existing house would probably be exempt, but a similar easement abandonment for the purpose of constructing a ten-unit apartment building probably would not be exempt. --- Page

--- Chunk 1798 ---
975 --- OAKLAND 975 B. Applicability of Single and Multiple Exemptions. A project may be subject to more than one exemption from CEQA, in which case all applicable exemptions may be cited. If it is determined that a particular exemption does not apply to a project because of the qualifiers pertaining to that exemption, the project may still be exempt under another exemption. For example, a project involving grading and the construction of a new single- family home on a site with a fifteen (15) percent slope would not be exempt under Categorical Exemption Class 4, "Minor Alterations to Land," because of the qualifier that the slope be less than ten percent, but could still be exempt under Categorical Exemption Class 3, "New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures," because that class has no qualifier pertaining to slope. However, the "rule of reason" must be applied when considering possible multiple exemptions. For example, it would not be reasonable to exempt a five hundred (500) unit subdivision on a flat site under Class 4 because the project involved grading on a slope of less than ten percent. (Ord. 12776 § 3, Exh. A (part), 2006: Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994:

--- Chunk 1799 ---
prior planning code § 1240) 17.158.280 Categorical exemptions. Section 15022(a)(1)(c) of the State CEQA Guidelines requires cities to list those specific activities that are considered to be within the twenty-nine (29) classes of categorical exemptions listed in Article 19 of the Guidelines, provided that none of the exceptions to categorical exemptions identified in Guidelines Section 15300.2, nor any of the qualifiers listed in the individual exemption classes in Sections 15301 through 15329, inclusive, of the State CEQA Guidelines, apply.

Installation of cogeneration equipment meeting the conditions as described in Section 15329 of the CEQA Guidelines (Section 15329(a)(1)(2),(b)(1) (2)(3), Class 29). (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1250) 17.158.290 Statutory exemptions. As described in Section 15260 through Section 15277, inclusive, of the CEQA Guidelines, there are statutory exemptions to CEQA granted by the State Legislature. The purpose of statutory exemptions is to excuse the environmental review process for an entire class of projects. This is in contrast to categorical exemptions where there may be exceptions cited if the proposed project would otherwise have a potentially adverse environmental effect. The list and description of statutory exemptions is not a comprehensive listing as cited in CEQA or the CEQA Guidelines, but rather, it is a list of those that are pertinent to the city. Omission of statutory exemptions that are found in CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, do not void their appropriate application to specific projects in instances shown below. Therefore, statutory exemptions are described but not limited to those below: A. Ongoing Project. 1. If a public project was approved prior to November

--- Chunk 1804 ---
23, 1970, the project shall be exempt from CEQA unless a substantial portion of public funds allocated for the --- Page 978 --- OAKLAND 978 project have not been spent, making it feasible to modify the project or in some other way mitigate potentially adverse environmental effects. An ongoing project may also be subject to CEQA if there are modifications to the project in such a way that there may be new significant effect on the environment (Section 15261(a)(1)(2)). 2. A private project is exempt from CEQA if the project received an entitlement for use from a public agency prior to April 5, 1973, unless after April 5, 1973, the project received additional discretionary governmental approvals that involve a greater degree of responsibility or control over the project as a whole than did the approvals of entitlements prior to April 5, 1973 (Section 15261(b)(1) (2)(3)). B. Feasibility and Planning Studies. Feasibility and planning studies for possible future actions which have not been approved, adopted, or funded are exempt. However, the study should still require environmental consideration. This statutory exemption would not apply to the adoption of a plan that will have a legally binding effect on later activities. For example,

--- Chunk 1805 ---
the adoption of the Oakland general plan would be subject to CEQA, and an EIR should be prepared (Section 15262). C. General Plan Time Extension. The granting of a time extension by the State Office of Planning and Research to the city for the preparation and adoption of one or more elements of the general plan would be statutorily exempt (Section 15266). D. Ministerial Projects. Ministerial projects as defined by Section 17.158.090, and described in Section 17.158.180, are exempt from the requirements of CEQA (Section 15268). E. Emergency Projects. The following projects are defined as emergency projects and not subject to CEQA: 1. Projects to maintain, repair, restore, demolish, or replace property or facilities damaged or destroyed as a result of a disaster in a disaster stricken area in which a state of emergency has been proclaimed by the Governor pursuant to the California Emergency Services Act (Section 15269(a)). 2. Emergency repairs to public service facilities necessary to maintain service (Section 15269(b)). 3. Specific actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency (Section 15269(c)). F. Projects Which are Disapproved. This statutory exemption allows disapproval on the merits of a project prior to the initiation of the CEQA process, where the

--- Chunk 1806 ---
city can clearly see that findings for the project cannot be made (Section 15270(a)(b)(c)). G. Specified Mass Transit Projects. The institution or increase of passenger or commuter service on rail lines or high-occupancy vehicle lanes already in use, including the modernization of existing stations and parking facilities; facility extensions not to exceed four miles in length which are required for transfer of passengers from or to exclusive public mass transit guideway or busway public transit services (Section 15275(a)(b)). H. Railroad Grade Separation Projects. Railroad grade projects which eliminate an existing grade crossing or which reconstruct an existing grade separation (Section 21080.13). I. Restriping of Streets or Highways. Projects for restriping of streets or highways to relieve traffic congestion (Section 21080.19). J. Right-of-Way. Projects of less than one mile in length within a public street or highway, or any other public right-of-way for the installation of a new pipeline or the maintenance, repair, restoration, reconditioning, relocation, replacement, removal, or demolition of an existing pipeline (Section 21080.21). --- Page 979 --- OAKLAND 979 (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1260) 17.158.300 General rule exemptions. As authorized by Section 15061(b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines, the Environmental Review Officer, or

--- Chunk 1807 ---
his/her representative may determine that although a project may not be statutorily or categorically exempt from CEQA, a preliminary review can with reasonable certainty show that there is no possibility that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. Therefore, the project would not be subject to CEQA. The general rule would apply where it can be plainly seen without an initial study that a proposed project would not exceed the critical thresholds for adverse environmental effects. For example, in the case of a zoning change where the new zoning classification is at least as restrictive or more restrictive as the existing zoning classification for an area. Such a condition would occur if an area were downzoned from a multifamily zoning classification to a single-family zoning district.

The provisions of this article shall be known as the environmental review process. The purpose of these provisions is to prescribe the procedures for preparing and processing CEQA

--- Chunk 1808 ---
environmental documents, including initial studies, negative declarations, mitigated negative declarations, and environmental impact reports. This process shall apply to all projects which are determined to require environmental review under CEQA. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1300) 17.158.320 CEQA environmental review process. The following description of the environmental review process is illustrated by Figure 2, Environmental Review Process Under CEQA. A. Request for Environmental Review. If after review of a request for determination of environmental exemption the Environmental Review Officer finds that a project is not exempt, or it can be clearly seen by a project sponsor that a public or private project is not exempt, a request for environmental review and fee shall be submitted and shall be accompanied by information which, in the judgment of the environmental review officer, is sufficient to permit completion of an initial study. Consistent with Section 15102 of the --- Page 980 --- OAKLAND 980 CEQA Guidelines, the Environmental Review Officer shall determine within thirty (30) days after accepting an application as complete whether the city intends to prepare an EIR or a negative declaration or use a previously prepared EIR or negative declaration. However, failure to determine whether

--- Chunk 1809 ---
an EIR or negative declaration is needed within the required time frame shall in no way prejudice the city from requiring such documents. This thirty (30) day period may be extended fifteen (15) days upon the mutual consent of the city and the project applicant. Typically, the information needed to prepare an initial study may include but may not be limited to the following: 1. Project description; 2. Statement of project objectives; 3. Site plan and elevations; 4. Preliminary drainage plan; 5. Preliminary grading plan; 6. Preliminary landscaping plan; 7. Completed environmental checklist form. B. Initial Study. Initial study of the environmental effects of the project shall be conducted by the Environmental Review Officer or the Environmental Review Coordinator using a comprehensive checklist form authorized by the Environmental Review Officer. An initial study need not be prepared if the Environmental Review Officer, after preliminary review, determines that the project clearly may have a significant effect on the environment and that an EIR should be prepared (CEQA Guidelines Section 15060(c)). The determination of the Environmental Review Officer that an EIR is required may be appealed by the project sponsor as described in Section 17.158.220B. C. Thresholds of Significant Environmental Impact. The

--- Chunk 1810 ---
Environmental Review Officer may prepare criteria for assessing significant adverse environmental impact thresholds, that the City Planning Commission may adopt to serve as guidelines for determining the levels of significant effects on the environment. As guiding standards, the threshold criteria would be used to provide information in evaluating the environmental effects of a project, and to assist in determining whether a proposed project would be exempt or require additional environmental review. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1310—1313) 17.158.330 Preparation of negative declarations. If the Environmental Review Officer determines on the basis of the initial study that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, a negative declaration shall be prepared. --- Page 981 --- OAKLAND 981 --- Page 982 --- OAKLAND 982 When a project would require federal funding or federal agency approvals, a joint CEQA/NEPA environmental document may be prepared to satisfy the requirements of both federal and state environmental standards. A notice of finding of no significant impact (FONSI) prepared for the project to meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements may serve as a valid substitute for a negative declaration required under CEQA; provided, that the procedures for the

--- Chunk 1811 ---
preparation of a negative declaration listed below are satisfied. 1. The Environmental Review Officer shall have notices posted consistent with the notification requirements as prescribed by Sections 17.134.040A and B, 17.136.040, 17.140.030, 17.142.030, 17.144.060 and 17.148.040A and B of the Oakland Zoning Regulations. The notice shall advise interested citizens that a negative declaration has been prepared. The notification of responsible and trustee agencies, private individuals, and property owners shall be consistent with notification for discretionary action on other related permits for the project. When the project has no identifiable site, such notices shall be substituted by a notice published one time in a newspaper of general circulation. The Environmental Review Officer may use additional means of notification, such as prescribed by Section 17.130.020 of the Oakland Zoning Regulations. 2. A period of at least twenty-one (21) calendar days following the date the notices are placed at the site or published in the newspaper shall be allowed for response prior to action on the negative declaration by the decision-making body. However, when a negative declaration has been submitted to the State Clearinghouse, the review period shall be at least as long as that of the Clearinghouse (normally thirty (30) days). Negative

--- Chunk 1812 ---
declarations, as well as draft EIRs are submitted to the State Clearinghouse when one or more state agency would have either permit approval, or trustee status for natural resources affected by the proposed project. 3. A notice that the city proposes to adopt a negative declaration shall be forwarded to interested persons or parties as specified in the Guidelines Section 15072 et seq. In addition, it shall be forwarded to members of the City Planning Commission; if the project is subject to approval by the Planning Commission, this may be done at the same time the Commission is sent the staff report on the project application. The Environmental Review Officer will notify any public agency and private individual which commented on the negative declaration, of the public hearings on the project for which the negative declaration was prepared. 4. The negative declaration notice shall invite written challenges to the finding of no significant effect as set forth Section 17.158.220C. If the negative declaration is forwarded to the State Clearinghouse, it shall also be accompanied by a "notice of completion and environmental document transmittal form." 5. At the conclusion of the public comment and challenge period, the negative declaration shall be

--- Chunk 1813 ---
signed and dated by the Environmental Review Officer, declaring that the document has been prepared in accordance to CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and these environmental review regulations. If challenges were received during the public comment period, and such challenges were rejected by the City Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall have the Environmental Review Officer attach an explanation for the rejection to the negative declaration. 6. The Environmental Review Officer shall forward the negative declaration to the appropriate sponsoring department for public projects, or to the project sponsor for a private project, for the project sponsor to forward to the decision-making body which has jurisdiction for approving or denying the project. --- Page 983 --- OAKLAND 983 7. Decision on the project shall take place as outlined in Section 17.158.200 B. Preparation of a Mitigated Negative Declaration. If the initial study identified potentially significant environmental effects, but revisions to the proposed project plans or proposals made by or agreed to by the project sponsor would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur, and there is no substantial evidence before the Environmental Review Officer that the project as revised may have

--- Chunk 1814 ---
a significant effect on the environment, then the Environmental Review Officer may have prepared a mitigated negative declaration. In addition, a mitigated negative declaration may be prepared in the event a negative declaration is prepared and subsequently challenged, or if the Planning Commission decides prior to a decision on the project to require a mitigated negative declaration. The following procedures would apply. If there are mitigation measures that can be readily identified by the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative, that can clearly reduce or avoid the significant adverse environmental effects that were identified in the initial study or through the public comment period, the Environmental Review Officer will recommend that the project sponsor agree to incorporate the mitigation measures into the proposed project. A written letter identifying the mitigation measures will be sent to the project sponsor. The project sponsor will have fourteen (14) days upon receipt of the letter, to respond to the Environmental Review Officer indicating agreement to incorporate the mitigation measures into the proposed project. Upon the mutual agreement between the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative, and the project sponsor, the project sponsor may be given a reasonable extension of time to consider the incorporation

--- Chunk 1815 ---
of the identified mitigation measures, provided the project sponsor has requested the time extension with the fourteen (14) day response period. If within the fourteen (14) day period, the project sponsor either refuses to the terms of the letter, or does not respond within the time frame, the Environmental Review Officer will make a determination that an EIR would be required for the project. The procedures for preparing an EIR as outlined in this statement would then apply. If however, the project sponsor agrees to the mitigation measures necessary to avoid or reduce the identified significant environmental effects to a level of insignificance, the mitigated negative declaration should be processed as outlined by steps 1 through 7 for a negative declaration as described in Section 17.158.330. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1400—1402) 17.158.340 Preparation of environmental impact reports. A. Preparation of Draft EIR. If it is determined that the proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment, an EIR shall be prepared. Such determination may be made by the Environmental Review Officer during the preliminary review of the project, or after the preparation of an initial study. The City Planning Commission or the

--- Chunk 1816 ---
City Council may also call for the preparation of an EIR. The project sponsor may appeal the determination by the Environmental Review Officer to prepare an EIR to the City Planning Commission as set forth in Section 17.158.220B. When the Environmental Review Officer has collected the EIR fee from the project sponsor, the Environmental Review Officer shall send via U.S. mail to each responsible agency a notice of preparation (NOP) stating that an EIR will be prepared. The NOP will be sent via U.S. mail to all responsible and trustee agencies, all surrounding communities who share a border with the city, individuals, organizations who have expressed an interest in the project or in projects in their areas of concern and interest, and owners of property which share a boundary with the site of the proposed project. The Environmental Review Officer shall have notices posted consistent with --- Page 984 --- OAKLAND 984 the notification requirements as prescribed by Sections 17.134.040A and B, 17.136.040, 17.140.030, 17.142.030, 17.144.060 and 17.148.040A and B of the Oakland Zoning Regulations. When the project has no identifiable site, such notices shall be substituted by a notice published one time in a newspaper of general circulation. The

--- Chunk 1817 ---
Environmental Review Officer may use additional means of notification, such as prescribed by Section 17.130.020 of the Oakland Zoning Regulations. B. The NOP shall contain sufficient information describing the proposed project and the potential environmental effects identified by the city. At a minimum, the NOP shall include the following information: 1. Description of the project area; 2. Location of the project as shown on a map; 3. Probable environmental effects of the proposed project. All agencies, organizations and individuals shall have thirty (30) days after receiving the NOP to respond with specific detail about the scope and content of the environmental information to be contained in the draft EIR. When one or more state agency will be either a responsible or trustee agency, the Environmental Review Officer will have the NOP sent to the State Clearinghouse. The State Clearinghouse will ensure that the state agencies reply to the city within the required time. If a project would require federal agency funding or approval, the project will also need to comply with the federal NEPA requirements or procedures in addition to CEQA requirements. An environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared for the project to meet NEPA requirements may be substituted for the

--- Chunk 1818 ---
CEQA-required EIR provided that the EIS, or a combined EIR/EIS must comply with NEPA and CEQA statutory requirements. C. The following are the minimum procedures for the preparation of an draft EIR, and may be supplemented as necessary by the Environmental Review Officer: 1. Pre-Qualification Procedure. The Director of City Planning shall prepare a standardized procedure for the selection of qualified environmental consultants. 2. Preparation of the Administrative Draft of the Draft EIR. The environmental consultant shall prepare an administrative draft of the draft EIR (ADEIR). The ADEIR is an internal document to be comprehensively reviewed by the city to ensure the adequacy of the environmental document to meet the objectives of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and this statement. When the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative, is satisfied that the document represents, in his or her judgment, an accurate and complete draft EIR, and that it is ready for public review, he or she shall sign a declaration to this effect which shall constitute the top sheet of the released report. The declaration shall invite responses to the report, give the final date for receipt of such responses, advise to whom responses shall be addressed, and provide other pertinent

--- Chunk 1819 ---
information. At this time, the draft EIR is released for public review and comment, and the project sponsor may also review and comment on the draft EIR. D. Public Review of Draft EIR. A period of no less than thirty (30) days following the release of the draft EIR by the Environmental Review Officer shall be allowed for public review of the draft EIR. If the State Clearinghouse is involved, the review period shall be at least forty-five (45) calendar days. The State Clearinghouse shall be involved if one or more state agency would have jurisdiction by law with respect to the proposed project, or if the environmental effects of the proposed project would have statewide, regional or areawide significance --- Page 985 --- OAKLAND 985 according to the criteria set forth in Section 15206 of the CEQA Guidelines. The review period shall begin when the site has been posted or a notice has been published as specified below. 1. The Environmental Review Officer shall have notices posted consistent with the notification requirements as prescribed by Sections 17.134.040A and B, 17.136.040, 17.140.030, 17.142.030, 17.144.060 and 17.148.040A and B of the Oakland Zoning Regulations, to advise interested persons that a draft

--- Chunk 1820 ---
EIR has been prepared and that comments are invited. Notices of Availability shall advise interested citizens that a draft EIR has been prepared. The notification of responsible and trustee agencies, private individuals, and property owners shall be consistent with notification for discretionary action on other related permits for the project. When the project has no identifiable site, such notices shall be substituted by a notice published one time in a newspaper of general circulation. The Environmental Review Officer may use additional means of notification, such as prescribed by Section 17.130.020 of the Oakland Zoning Regulations. 2. The Environmental Review Officer shall provide a copy of the draft EIR to: a. Project sponsor. b. Each member of the City Planning Commission. c. All persons and organizations who have requested it. d. The Oakland Main Library and, if appropriate, the branch library closest to the site of the project. e. Other state, regional or local agencies, which have jurisdiction by law and/or special expertise with respect to the environmental characteristics of the project or the project location, as specified in the CEQA Guidelines Section 15087(f). The city may charge and collect a reasonable fee for each copy of the draft EIR to

--- Chunk 1821 ---
recover actual costs for reproduction of the document as allowed under CEQA Guidelines Section 15045. 3. The City Planning Commission may schedule and conduct a public hearing on the draft EIR. CEQA Guidelines Section 15087 states that public hearings are encouraged, but not required as an element of the CEQA public participation process. E. Preparation of Final EIR. The final EIR shall consist of the draft EIR, summary or verbatim comments and recommendations received during the public comment period on the draft EIR; a list of persons, organizations and public agencies commenting on the draft EIR; the responses of the lead agency to significant environmental points raised in the review and consultation process (Section 15132 of the CEQA Guidelines). After a final EIR has been prepared, it shall be forwarded to the City Planning Commission for certification. Such certification shall be deemed to be a finding that the document has been prepared in compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and this statement. In addition, the City Planning Commission shall also certify that the final EIR reflects the independent judgment of the city. Certification of the final EIR does not imply that the City Planning Commission endorses the proposed project, nor

--- Chunk 1822 ---
that the permit application(s) for the project will be approved. The final EIR shall be prefaced by a signed cover sheet carrying this certification. The cover sheet shall also note that the preparation of the final EIR has been overseen by the Environmental Review Officer or his/her representative, and that the conclusions and recommendations in the document represent the independent conclusions and recommendations of the city. --- Page 986 --- OAKLAND 986 1. The Environmental Review Officer shall forward the final EIR to the City Planning Commission, or to the appropriate decision-making body in the city. 2. Decision on the project shall take place as outlined in Section 17.158.200 F. Mitigation Monitoring Program. CEQA, as amended by AB 3180 requires local agencies to establish a monitoring program to ensure that the measures to mitigate the environmental impacts of approved projects are implemented. The purpose of the mitigation monitoring program is to ensure that all significant environmental impacts identified in the environmental documentation that can be mitigated, will indeed be mitigated after the project is approved. For a project for which a mitigated negative declaration or an EIR has been certified, at the time the project is approved, the mitigation measures

--- Chunk 1823 ---
will be compiled into a checklist form. The checklist will identify the agency responsible for ensuring that the mitigation measure is implemented. The Environmental Review Officer or his representative will provide a mitigation monitoring compliance form to each agency identified on the checklist form. The compliance form will identify the mitigation measure, and allow spaces for compliance date, and inspection or field survey dates. The compliance form shall be returned to the Environmental Review Officer when the mitigation measures have been implemented. (Ord. 11766 § 2 (part), 1994: prior planning code § 1500—1505, 1510)
